1
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,047
Don't you dare move!

2
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,713
You've the right to remain silent.

3
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:45,158
Don't you dare move
or else we will shoot you!

4
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:03,997
Hello, everyone.

5
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,098
How's everyone doing?

6
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,542
Hey Martin, having a Martini, huh?

7
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,704
Hi. How are you?

8
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,705
Good! Good! Good!

9
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,471
Margret, keep serving
sausages to everyone.

10
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,075
<i>- Hey Hites...
- All fine.</i>

11
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,678
- Hello.
- Is she your latest?

12
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,416
Call it the grace of God.

13
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,718
Batook, my friend!

14
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,985
Looking at your success...
makes me really happy.

15
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,725
Human beings should always be happy,
you know.

16
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,092
Because even Gautam's...
'Gambhir' (Serious).

17
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,001
I am the one who's really happy.

18
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,527
<i>Because you didn't come alone...</i>

19
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,672
...for the inauguration
of GJS shipping's new branch.

20
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,642
In fact, you brought
your wife and kids too.

21
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,135
I'll tell you why I
brought them here later.

22
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,542
First call your daughters.

23
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,239
Should I?

24
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,302
Yes.

25
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,742
Ganga!

26
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,313
Jamuna!

27
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,023
Saraswati!

28
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:03,659
"Ganga...".

29
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,597
"Jamuna..."

30
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:12,602
" Saraswati!"

31
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,986
So Maalaya, they are my GJS.

32
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,717
My dues cultured jewels.

33
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,518
You've come for the table, right?

34
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,588
Come for the table meaning,
are you com-for-table?

35
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,093
It's a literal translation.

36
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,126
You see, they grew up
in a English surrounding...

37
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,004
...but sometimes their
Indian-ness comes out...

38
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,440
...and the end result is
a totally different translation.

39
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:46,440
So tell me. Maalaya.

40
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,443
You said call the girls.

41
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,510
Now they are here, so tell me.

42
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:52,448
Batook... I want my sons Harry,
Harsh and Hulk...

43
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,246
...to marry your three daughters.

44
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,308
I was thinking they can
have a wedding in Turkey...

45
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:02,682
Maalaya, I am the only
father on this planet...

46
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,992
...who doesn't want his
daughters to get married.

47
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:12,099
I will never let my
daughters marry anyone... ever!

48
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,271
Call it a curse, or bad luck.
I don't know.

49
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:21,511
But my family's been enduring
this ill-fate for decades.

50
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:26,311
Within 3 years of marriage,
my parents split.

51
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,108
My darling wife Hetal...

52
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:32,118
...passed-away after
delivering my children.

53
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,391
My eldest sister, Hansa.

54
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,520
Her husband divorced her
within 6 months of their marriage.

55
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,729
And my aunt Sarla...

56
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,000
...suffered a hemorrhage after
she returned from her honeymoon.

57
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,106
When things keep occurring often,
it's called a coincidence.

58
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,436
But if it keeps
repeating every time...

59
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,301
...then it's an indication from God.

60
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,403
And a smart man can
understand an indication.

61
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,643
But Batook,
life without marriage and children..

62
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,378
This is the truth, uncle. Believe us.

63
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,681
We're not making kids.

64
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,390
She's saying... we're not kidding.

65
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:10,684
Oh my. God!

66
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,950
Pops!

67
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,554
Marriage seems to be out of question.

68
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,065
How about a live-in relationship?

69
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,056
What did you say?

70
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:19,663
I heard that.

71
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,694
You bloody pervert!

72
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,269
My son Hulk meant to say...

73
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,968
Your son isn't hulk he is rascal!

74
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:29,172
And you... you're not Maalaya
you're a bloody scoundrel.

75
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,738
And you aren't Godhavri
you're a rhino.

76
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,608
Live in relation? Get out! Get out!

77
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:34,707
Get out!

78
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,476
- Please stop it.
- Get out!

79
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,112
Just go.

80
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,416
And don't take the boat.

81
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,616
Swim all the way back.

82
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,216
'Job down.'

83
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,290
Calm down.

84
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,722
You three are so smart.

85
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,399
You have never thought
about boys till date.

86
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,235
You three are so naive.

87
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,734
Bottom line,
a person should always be straight.

88
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,735
Because... even Taarak Mehta's glasses
are upside down.

89
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,311
Goodnight, papa!

90
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,114
Goodnight... so soon?

91
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,349
My daughters are so cultured.

92
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,958
Jenny, everyone knows
you don't have a boyfriend.

93
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,020
There are lot of girls here,
choose one.

94
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,019
Sherley. Grow up and go up!

95
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:26,546
What?

96
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:27,612
Grow up.

97
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,050
I have a boyfriend.

98
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,550
His name is Teddy.

99
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,062
So come on, tell me right now...

100
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,566
...about your boyfriend.
- No way.

101
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,659
If you don't,
I will tell your sisters.

102
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,563
Then listen.

103
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,371
He's a guy who is a little bit crazy.

104
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:55,350
"When I saw you, I realized sweetheart."

105
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:59,514
But his tongue slips... day and night.

106
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,181
"Love is crazy, sweetheart."

107
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,127
Jenny. Will you be my wench?

108
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,186
I mean... wife!

109
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,331
Just like Michael Schumacher...

110
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,732
...he wants to be a no.1 car racer.

111
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,201
And just this morning...
he got a golden chance.

112
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,542
The Indian racer has
broken the all time record.

113
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,017
It's a 50 lap race.

114
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,543
And can you believe it, Jennifer?

115
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,123
He's been racing through
the track like a bullet.

116
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,352
Racer no.
3 has now over taken racer. No 2.

117
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:40,328
And wow! He has now taken
over the lead front the Indian racer.

118
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,363
Wait. What a reply.

119
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,061
Teddy has taken back
the lead with full throttle.

120
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,164
There is no stopping this guy.

121
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,826
Teddy has almost
reached the finish line.

122
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,267
He can see it.

123
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,207
What happened, Roger?

124
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,616
What's wrong with his car'?

125
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,014
I'm out of petrol?

126
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,111
Shit!

127
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,723
...the lead car has come
to a screeching halt.

128
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,020
Just 200 meters away
from the finishing line.

129
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,121
What do I do now?

130
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,603
Yes!

131
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,105
Wow Teddy.

132
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,685
You're so stool?

133
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,085
I mean... you're so cool.

134
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,085
And the winner of today's race,
ladies and gentlemen...

135
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,387
Is Steve Randall.

136
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,414
Hey!

137
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:17,983
Well done.

138
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,756
Fantastic racing! Fantastic driving!

139
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,623
Sir... sir... sir... I came first

140
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,630
I finished first

141
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,634
Teddy, Teddy this was a car race...

142
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,135
...not a running race.

143
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,500
Okay, here I go.

144
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,706
Love you baby-boo. Yes I do.

145
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,147
I said it once, and I say it too.

146
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,445
I love you.

147
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,408
Oh!

148
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,017
<i>Hey.</i>

149
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,721
I want all the details about you
sweetheart right now

150
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,053
otherwise your sisters.

151
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:48,522
Look.

152
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:49,547
Okay...

153
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,615
Alright.

154
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,332
He's the 'apple of my eyes'.
- Huh?

155
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,167
He's the apple of my eyes.

156
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,457
Bunty!

157
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,127
What do you think
when you look at him?

158
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,719
<i>Sometimes I think...</i>

159
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,129
...that he's the son of some rich dad.

160
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,539
I'm here to take you blessings.

161
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,102
You see, I am a huge fan.

162
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,742
I've an audition today.

163
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,743
If I can get your blessings, well...

164
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,349
How about a selfie?

165
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,415
Just one?

166
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,297
But audition? Audition for what?

167
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,597
He's a hardcore rapper.

168
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,414
Still ain't amazed?
Let me pick up the pace.

169
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,998
Grab you. I popcorn... Ready... Go!

170
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,576
You'll see what I mean.
I be putting in the most..

171
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,343
Never meant to brag..
And I never meant to boast..

172
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,078
Other rappers out..
I'ma turn 'em into ghosts..

173
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,646
If you didn't get the..
Memo let me put in the post..

174
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,248
<i>If you didn't get the.
Meme I gotta let you know..</i>

175
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,683
Everytime I wanna spit..
Man I'm never goin' slow..

176
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,451
Everytime I grab the..
Mic I just never let it go..

177
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,614
Like I'm making love..
Baby I just go and I go...

178
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,518
- Extra-ordinary.
- Thank you.

179
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:36,228
What you just performed
was both extra... and ordinary!

180
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,809
'So what I heard about
the judge was right.'

181
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,294
'He's taken a bribe.'

182
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,996
So my judgment will be.

183
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,638
Before you pass any
further judgment...

184
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,302
...can I perform just one small piece?

185
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,442
Enough of this multiplex...

186
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,344
...now for the single-screen item.

187
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,779
One... two... three... four...

188
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:00,012
"Your mother-sister...
Mother-sister... Mother-sister..."

189
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:01,955
May you bones break..

190
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:02,719
Your head break..

191
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,483
Everyone should rob your dignity..

192
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,494
<i>May you get cursed with bugs,</i>

193
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,529
the bigger the better...

194
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,156
<i>May you get diarrhea.</i>

195
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,860
You're a dogs breed
so bite you own self..

196
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:10,693
You got messed up..

197
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:11,593
So you got kicked..

198
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,692
That too so very hard..

199
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,565
"Your mother-sister...
Mother-sister... Mother-sister..."

200
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,069
Impeccable!

201
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,709
But I cleanly understood
every little detail you said...

202
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,975
...about my sister to my mother!

203
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:30,710
You know Hindi?

204
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,053
I don't know about Bhuvan...

205
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,683
...but you're the one who will
have to pay twice the penalty.

206
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,124
You're disqualified.

207
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,292
I'm flying!

208
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,135
Yeah, you're flying.

209
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,130
Sherley, I am flying - By the way,
you've a boyfriend, right?

210
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,142
<i>How . . How did you know'?</i>

211
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,044
Just took a chance.

212
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,239
Come on... spill, shoot.

213
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,049
Everything about your boyfriend.
- Sherley...

214
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:05,078
If you tell anyone about this,
I will kick you donkey.

215
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,590
- Meaning?
- I will kick your ass.

216
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,393
His name is Sandy.

217
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:19,297
But that crazy chap is
always busy with his first love.

218
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,108
And I don't know why...

219
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,503
He gets a kick out of his 'kick'.

220
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,228
<i>"Goal".</i>

221
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,434
<i>"Goal".</i>

222
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,124
<i>"Goal".</i>

223
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,627
Coach... I don't need
to be a substitute anymore.

224
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:20,786
I am a good player.

225
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,259
Sandy, you're right.

226
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,331
You deserve to be
permanent on the field.

227
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,462
But not as an ordinary player.

228
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,739
As a water-boy!

229
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,742
But coach, he's too good.
- But, he's an Indian.

230
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,782
Indians are only
worthy to be our slaves.

231
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,478
Now get lost...

232
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:46,756
You... you... Indian.

233
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,185
The coach has lost it.

234
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,795
"You don't deserve to be here..."

235
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,292
"...you Indian."

236
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,691
"You Indian."

237
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,790
"You Indian."

238
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:01,162
Get out of here."

239
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,232
"You Indian."

240
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,305
...Indian!"

241
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,642
Now you listen you
while little willies.

242
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,412
Who said that?

243
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,147
That wasn't me.

244
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,050
I didn't say that.

245
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,253
- I said it.
- What...

246
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,027
The aggression from you. I depression!

247
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:37,129
If you're Sandy, then I am... Sundi!

248
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,232
Sundi?

249
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:42,678
Sundi!

250
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:48,542
As long as Sandy's miserable,
Sundi's on cloud nine.

251
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:49,778
What?

252
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,188
Ba-Ba Black Sheep have you any balls?

253
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,689
Yes, sir... yes, sir... three footballs.

254
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,753
One for the coach... one for his crony...

255
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,230
...and one for the other banana.

256
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,424
Get that idiot!

257
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:05,525
Sandy, now you die...
I am out of here.

258
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,035
No! No!

259
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,363
- Sandy.
- What happened?

260
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,136
You're suffering from
Split Personality Disorder.

261
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,360
Split...

262
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,169
It's a relatively rare disorder...

263
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,373
Sometimes due to depression...

264
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,172
...or financial problems,
a different personality...

265
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,583
...emerges from inside.

266
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,686
A completely different
person comes out.

267
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,746
And in your case...

268
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,183
- It's DID.
- Dance India Dance?

269
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,730
Dissociative Identity Disorder!

270
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:10,422
What's that?

271
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,428
Come, let's hang from outside.
- what?

272
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,231
Let's hang out.

273
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,727
Yes.

274
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,205
After studying your case...

275
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,212
...I'll advice you to avoid Indi..

276
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,215
...the I-N-D -I-A-N word.

277
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:28,451
When you heat this word,
Sundi will take your place.

278
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,550
Because all your life
you've been bullied...

279
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,555
...because of your race and color.

280
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,149
- You mean...
- I am sorry.

281
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,750
Just by hearing this single word...

282
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:41,154
How is this possible?
- It is possible, Sandy.

283
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,031
How do I explain it to you now?

284
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,058
Sandy.

285
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,266
My head is aching with pain.

286
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,439
Can you ask someone
to get me a black tea?

287
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,170
Sure.

288
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:55,540
Black!

289
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,045
Sandy!

290
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,646
Just like you change into Sundi
after hearing 'that' word...

291
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,014
...similarly,
when he hears the word 'black'...

292
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,108
Black!

293
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,213
Nurse! Nurse!

294
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,276
- Black!
- White. White.

295
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,118
You called me black...
- I am saying white.

296
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,211
White.

297
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,717
"He's another black..."

298
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:10,751
Relax.

299
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,016
Relax.

300
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,332
Will I never get better?
- Of course you will.

301
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:24,239
Sandy, things do change,
and you will overcome your depression.

302
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,635
And who knows...
someday you'll have enough money...

303
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,340
...to own your own football club.
- Dr. Patel!

304
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:31,709
Dr. Ganga Patel!

305
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,003
Two minutes. Two minutes.

306
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,340
Remove his black shirt.

307
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,747
Black!

308
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,111
Catch him! Catch him!

309
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,582
Where will I get that kind of money?

310
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,661
You know, my illness,
this buy 1 get 1 free thing...

311
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,472
...it can be cured permanently.

312
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,007
If you help me.

313
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,377
And for that... will you marry me?

314
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,212
Yes!

315
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,275
No!

316
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,513
Why?

317
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:21,494
We can go in for a live-in
relationship, but... not marriage.

318
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,122
Why?

319
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,600
You want to know?
- Yes, I want to... what!

320
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,330
Then listen.

321
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,741
What? Broken marriages! Death!

322
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,638
- Are you sure?
- Yes, Teddy.

323
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,518
I am 100 percent sure.

324
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,644
- Stella.
- Yes, ma'am.

325
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,721
Stella, will you
please fix this for me?

326
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,522
- But the money...
- Sure ma'am

327
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,458
I mean, honey it's possible that...

328
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,255
what didn't happen...

329
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,060
I mean, what happened with others...

330
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,461
...won't happen with us.

331
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,703
Look here, everyone got married.

332
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:00,964
Angelina-Brad Pitt.

333
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:01,992
Nicole.

334
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,398
<i>Shahrukh.</i>

335
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,461
And...

336
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:05,963
Except for one.

337
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:06,566
<i>Jenny.</i>

338
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,604
Every man dreams to be wealthy some day.
- what?

339
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,704
I mean... dreams of a wife.

340
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,209
Marries her.

341
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,307
And then...

342
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:16,674
Ohh...

343
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,080
Two sweet kids like these.

344
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:24,016
One like a single-screen type,
and other multi-plex type.

345
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,024
Take a look at me once Sarah.

346
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,995
It's just right there.
- Okay, thank you.

347
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,464
You know,
if we have two kids like these...

348
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,024
...do you know what we can say?

349
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,304
One, two, three four...

350
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,704
Our lives' pillars stand
on these two bamboos..

351
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:40,033
...wigedee wigedee boom boom dhoom dhoom
dhada bhooom pac dhoopac dhoom pac.

352
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,008
Bunty.

353
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,033
Bunty.

354
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,510
Have some cold medicine.

355
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,343
Take a chill-pill.

356
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,416
But, Sarah.

357
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,544
You know that I always come
and visit these special kids.

358
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,020
So you also keep in touch with them.

359
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,151
That's the least we can do.

360
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,496
But marriage... kids?

361
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:02,590
Just forget it.

362
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:07,195
Fine... then forget me.

363
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:11,164
Because now... I will get married to...

364
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,405
...my illness... and death.
- Sandy.

365
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,309
Can I say something Genelia?

366
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,507
I mean Jenny.

367
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:26,117
I always thought I'll
marry the one I love.

368
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,419
But since marriage
isn't possible, then...

369
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,525
Hold on, Teddy. Wait.

370
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,120
What's the point in stopping me now?

371
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,424
You know, Sarah.

372
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,135
I wanted to start a family with you.

373
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,405
But if not you, then...

374
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,354
Sir... how are the snacks?

375
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:03,655
<i>Not like my mummy, but okay.</i>

376
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:07,987
The phone's ringing.
It's a private number.

377
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,406
Papa.

378
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,509
Papa...

379
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:28,982
Papa...

380
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,375
what happened?

381
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,113
I have a boyfriend!

382
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:37,618
What?

383
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,317
What?

384
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,987
This is all that was left to hear.

385
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:41,588
- Papa...
- Listen to me.

386
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:42,659
No one ever listens to me.

387
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,032
I have no value in this house anymore.

388
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,034
Papa! Papa! Papa!

389
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,697
Papa! Please try and understand.

390
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:52,497
The one whom I love, his looks are..
- Quiet!

391
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,542
A person should have brains...

392
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:56,352
...because,
even Gujarat has a 'Surat' city!

393
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:57,604
Get that?

394
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,137
This marriage won't last.

395
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,081
It's bad luck. It's a curse.

396
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:04,283
Even the maids in my house
couldn't escape this curse.

397
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,150
Look at them, all three are widows.

398
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,082
I won't change my decision.

399
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,491
Papa, the maids are gone,
the maids are gone. - Huh'?

400
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:16,695
- Let bygones be bygones!
- Right.

401
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,992
Papa, we're not going
to be happy without them.

402
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,968
Papa, please let's take this chance.

403
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,597
Papa, let's be positive you know.

404
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,106
This broken marriage and death.

405
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,698
The reason is just so...

406
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,205
The reason's something else...

407
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,374
- Something else?
- Yes.

408
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:38,017
Tell me... which father in this world...

409
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,113
...wouldn't want his
daughters to get married?

410
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,317
There's a reason.
It's a really big reason.

411
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,122
But I can't tell you.

412
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,427
- Why?
- No. Sorry.

413
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:51,626
- Sorry...
- But...

414
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,225
- I love you.
- Papa.

415
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:56,763
Hold on, papa.

416
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,606
This isn't fair.
- I think you should tell us.

417
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,631
I can't believe this.

418
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:02,041
You have to tell us,
otherwise we will get married.

419
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,340
Yes!

420
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,145
'These girls will
definitely get married.'

421
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,767
'what reason can I give them now?'

422
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,249
'How do I stop this marriage?'

423
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,148
'who will help me?'

424
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,757
"Pasta!"

425
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,729
Batook sir, you're joking.
- Pasta...

426
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,061
You're my oldest customer.

427
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,264
Pizza for you.

428
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,068
We've known each other for years.

429
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,368
Bread for you.

430
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,535
But that doesn't mean
that your Aakhri Pasta...

431
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:37,069
...will pretend to be your
family astrologer Aakhri Aastha.

432
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,272
Pasta for you.

433
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,371
And you...

434
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,576
I haven't made Lucy
madam's breakfast yet.

435
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,744
How can I be Aakhri Aastha?

436
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:47,285
Pasta... it's the question
of my daughters' lives.

437
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:48,756
Don't you want to open many more...

438
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,158
...franchises of Aakhri Pasta
on London Rasta? - Yes.

439
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,388
Just like the McDonalds.

440
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:53,757
I will help you.

441
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:57,066
Just go meet my daughters
as Aakhri Aastha.

442
00:30:57,088 --> 00:31:00,626
Mumble some things in Hindi
along with fake astrology predictions...

443
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,729
...and stop these marriages,
that's all.

444
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:06,031
But just a minute,
I've another idea.

445
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,034
What idea?

446
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:07,734
Come, come.

447
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,638
The 'mamma-Mia idea.'
- Mamma-Mia?

448
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:15,151
Get you 3 daughters tubes-tied.

449
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,619
If they can't become mamma
they won't get a husband.

450
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,312
I am joking.

451
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,121
Listen, Pasta!

452
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,028
You must do this job!

453
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,256
And I am not joking!

454
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,763
"Pasta!"

455
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,034
"Pasta!"

456
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,476
You wanted to know...

457
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:45,170
...why I wouldn't let
you three get married.

458
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:52,248
This... is our family astrologer,
Aakhri Aastha.

459
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,284
Truth can be proved wrong.

460
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,188
But not his predictions.

461
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,090
"Pasta!"

462
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,325
"Pasta!"

463
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,028
The day Batook Patel's
daughter Ganga Patel's husband...

464
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:15,237
...sets foot in this house, Batook will
immediately suffer a heart-attack.

465
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,506
And he will die.

466
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,311
'Sets foot?'

467
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,541
You're a joking!

468
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,349
"Pasta!"

469
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:33,118
The day Batook Patel's
daughter Jamuna Patel's husband...

470
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:37,765
...sees him, Batook will immediately
suffer a heart-attack.

471
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,626
And he will die.

472
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,358
<i>See him?</i>

473
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:49,478
The day Batook Patel's daughter
Saraswati Patel's husband...

474
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:53,674
...speaks to him, Batook will
immediately suffer a heart-attack.

475
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,073
<i>Speaks to him?</i>

476
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:58,349
- No!
- Yes.

477
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,982
Batook Patel's fourth daughter...
- That's enough!

478
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,218
There's no one there.

479
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,694
Understood? Understood!

480
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,122
Aastha sir,
now you only tell us a way...

481
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:10,325
...where we can find such grooms for
these girls. First word, first step..

482
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,129
Forget it! Forget it!

483
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,335
The question is about
my life and death.

484
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:17,633
So I'll die.

485
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,407
Papa...
- I'll give up my life for your happiness.

486
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:21,431
Just a minute.

487
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,449
Patel... Open the third drawer
there's a knife in it.

488
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,042
"Pasta!"

489
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:32,620
Goodbye!

490
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,554
Papa...
- Stop... - Please.

491
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:37,718
Let me die.
- what are you doing?

492
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,359
- Leave it.
- What..

493
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:40,555
Wow!

494
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,359
Finally it's proven that...

495
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:46,060
...that fathers are
more valuable than love.

496
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,568
Love you.
- You're right, Aastha.

497
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,563
And anyway,
a person should have high values.

498
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,334
Because even Bheem's little.

499
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:53,767
Chhota Bheem.

500
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,065
Never saw it?

501
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:55,803
Forget it.

502
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,069
Come, Aastha,
I'll get you some breakfast.

503
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,079
<i>Yummy.</i>

504
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,014
I mean... of course.

505
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:07,312
What? As soon as I take my first step
towards him, your father will die'?

506
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:09,413
What?

507
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,614
You mean,
I'll look at him and he'll die?

508
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:13,120
What?

509
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,824
You mean,
I'll speak to him and he'll die?

510
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:43,248
Sir...

511
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,520
Hey mister... I don't
have any loose change.

512
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:46,754
No begging here. Get lost.

513
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,055
Sandy. Wait!

514
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:54,068
- He's the one whom I love.
- Him?

515
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:57,670
Yesterday you gave me good news,
and not a bad one, papa.

516
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:01,110
He takes his first step,
and you get a heart-attack.

517
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,274
The one I love... can never take
a step even if he wanted to.

518
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:10,084
And today... you. I life, his life...

519
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,012
...both are in my life.

520
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,230
<i>Greetings, papa.</i>

521
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:31,030
We are lovebirds.

522
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:36,211
But why do you stare like angry birds'?

523
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,043
We're a couple.

524
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:40,738
A pair.

525
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:47,648
Feet.

526
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,620
Sandy.

527
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,661
Tell papa about yourself.
Your hobbies.

528
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:01,567
Papa... my favorite place...

529
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,162
Paris!

530
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,975
Favorite sport... Para-gliding.

531
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,677
Favorite slippers...

532
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:11,701
Paragon!

533
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,583
Favorite food... Pear!

534
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,414
Favorite bird... Parrot!

535
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,990
When I get fever...
I take Paracetamol.

536
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:24,120
I always watch... Paramount films.

537
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:30,526
I never talk in sentences...
only in paragraphs.

538
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,629
There's "feet" in every line,
but his feet only don't work.

539
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,602
- What?
- Papa.

540
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:38,004
I mean... what else is going on, son?

541
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,496
What's going on?

542
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,607
Everything else is going,
except for me...

543
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,110
...who isn't going anywhere.

544
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,137
How will he do?

545
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,442
<i>Papa, your heart will keep
beating if he doesn't walk...</i>

546
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:47,244
...so he will have to do.

547
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:50,012
<i>Did you have to settle for him?</i>

548
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,594
Teddy!

549
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,096
Teddy, stop.

550
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,967
Papa... Gracy, this is the man I love.

551
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,209
Your son-in-law will see you,
and you will get a heart-attack.

552
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,110
Look at him, poor guy can't see.

553
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,008
Go on, Teddy. Meet papa.

554
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,995
Papa... love is blind.

555
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,990
But in my case,
the lover is blind, papa.

556
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,102
Teddy, to you right.
- Papa's over there, please go there.

557
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:43,503
Yes, that's papa.

558
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,731
Papa, how are you?

559
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,136
Papa, I had a feeling...

560
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,312
...you will condom me.
- Huh!

561
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,244
I mean... condemn me.

562
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,041
Teddy, tell him about yourself.

563
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,608
Your likes, your dislikes.
- Yeah.

564
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,052
Myself Teddy.

565
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,088
My favorite color...

566
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,382
Black.

567
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,156
My friends call me 'Justice'.

568
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:10,165
Because Justice is blind, papa.

569
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:14,359
When I play cards,
I always play blind.

570
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,969
I was born in the ICU.

571
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,375
And my bank I use is ICICI.

572
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,206
I swear on my mother... papa.

573
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,608
Hold on.

574
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,308
Where did you find him?
- Papa, we met on a blind date.

575
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,013
Open your eyes, dear.

576
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,020
Can't you see that he can't see?

577
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:35,389
But papa, he's the reason I can now see
you for the rest of my life. <i>- -</i> Who's he'?

578
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,491
In all this show-and-tell you
didn't see what you should've seen.

579
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,392
And what you saw isn't worth seeing.

580
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:40,987
Open your eyes and see for yourself.

581
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,020
Who's that?

582
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:44,995
Who's coming now?

583
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,080
He's here.

584
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,679
Look, he's here.

585
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,716
Meet my love. Bunty.

586
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,358
Oh, Sarah.

587
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:18,959
Papa, you were saying you son-in-law
will speak... - I get it.

588
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:22,501
The one you said I love you,
can't say it back.

589
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,394
Okay.

590
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,169
Love is cute.

591
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,270
But...

592
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:36,609
In this case, the lover... is mute.

593
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,429
Tell us something about yourself.

594
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:41,718
Okay.

595
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:44,516
My favorite song...

596
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:48,422
"speak... speak ...speak... Mr. Bachchan."

597
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,521
"Listen. What say Mr. Bachchan?"

598
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,999
"speak... speak ...speak... Mr. Bachchan."
- Hey... is there dance show going on'?

599
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,629
"Listen. What say Mr. Bachchan?"

600
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,730
AB.

601
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,032
CD.

602
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:09,143
I am a CD player that's...

603
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,211
Singham?

604
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,648
Itchiness?

605
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:19,456
...whose speaker... is blown.

606
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,165
<i>My sweety ...my love...</i>

607
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:28,431
wow! Superb! Great.

608
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,064
All lines in this mute are amazing.

609
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:33,774
No I-phone.

610
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,038
No talk-time.

611
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,778
No balance.

612
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:42,145
- Papa...
- Come on, don't worry.

613
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,777
<i>Papa, think of the coincidence...</i>

614
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,578
we sisters
hit the eye of a bull.

615
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,182
We hit the bulls-eye.

616
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,159
Let's take a selfie.

617
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,286
Come on, Teddy.

618
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:57,094
We'll all stay together now until
we get married. - Wait, wait.

619
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,427
<i>"Sometime she Minks,
sometimes she winks."</i>

620
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:28,055
"But all the time
links my eyes with hers."

621
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,524
<i>"Sometime he blinks,
sometimes he winks."</i>

622
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,559
"But all the time
links my eyes with his."

623
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,570
"The moons showing attitude."

624
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,663
"Even the sun's talking gibberish."

625
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:45,373
"In this awesome weather
give me a English kiss."

626
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,470
"Bloody love..."

627
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,483
"Bloody love... From today
love will be like a prayer."

628
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:50,574
"Bloody love..."

629
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,588
"Bloody love... From today
love will be like a prayer."

630
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:54,588
"Bloody love..."

631
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:57,592
"Bloody love... From today
love will be like a prayer."

632
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,659
"Bloody love..."

633
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,525
"Bloody love..."

634
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,713
"I've a desire to die again."

635
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:23,648
"Because of the way
my tormentor killed me."

636
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:28,647
"You came walking on a velvet carpet."

637
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:31,625
"Then how did your feet get hurt?"

638
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,131
"You pierced my heart with you eyes."

639
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:39,259
"My heart's totally
blossomed by love."

640
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:43,465
"Bloody love... From today
love will be like a prayer."

641
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,437
"Bloody love..."

642
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:47,465
"Bloody love... From today
love will be like a prayer."

643
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,475
"Bloody love..."

644
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,479
"Bloody love... From today
love will be like a prayer."

645
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,570
"Bloody love..."

646
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,445
"Bloody love..."

647
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:14,594
I'll have to test these three rats.

648
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:19,005
<i>"If you become my dear, like
a small baby I'll take care of you."</i>

649
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:23,102
"when we're in love, then
why did your father call the priest?"

650
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,973
"I've just one thing to say to you,
I sweat..."

651
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:27,140
"...you're stuck to
me like chewing gum."

652
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,773
"Oh baby, have mercy on our love."

653
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,144
"You're my bread, and I am your jam."

654
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,243
"Ba Ba Ba Ba Black sheep,
have you any wool?"

655
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,312
"My heart's lost in your lanes."

656
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,155
"Also Jack and Jill went up the hill."

657
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:39,353
"Come on baby to the
garden of love and chill."

658
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,158
"You're my life..."

659
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,258
"My heart beats for you, baby."

660
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,327
"Now come make me your lady."

661
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:54,334
"You're my life..."

662
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:56,436
"Just keep the fun flowing."

663
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,572
"No stopping and no slowing."

664
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,407
"The moons showing attitude."

665
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,416
"Even the sun's talking gibberish."

666
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:08,183
"In this awesome weather
give me a English kiss."

667
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:10,214
"Bloody love..."

668
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,227
"Bloody love... From today
love will be like a prayer."

669
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,387
"Bloody love..."

670
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:17,297
"Bloody love... From today
love will be like a prayer."

671
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,425
"Bloody love..."

672
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,436
"Bloody love... From today
love will be like a prayer."

673
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,492
"Bloody love..."

674
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,335
"Bloody love..."

675
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:44,251
"Bloody love... From today
love will be like a prayer."

676
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:50,761
"Bloody love... From today
love will be like a prayer."

677
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,199
what are you thinking, Teddy?

678
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:07,671
<i>Come on, jump.</i>

679
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,740
Don't worry.

680
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,314
Can you see the water?

681
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:13,479
I mean heat the water.
It's filled with water. It's full.

682
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,217
It's full.

683
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,122
Look... warm water. Warm water.

684
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,216
Look.

685
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:22,725
Come on. I am right here.

686
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,023
Just jump, and we'll swim together.

687
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,534
- Teddy.
- What?

688
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:31,005
Jump.
- No. Papa. I can't jump today.

689
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:31,631
Why?

690
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,232
I am observing a fast today...
no-water fast.

691
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:38,343
I don't drink on this day,
and definitely not bathe.

692
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:41,041
Just jump,
papa's doing the countdown.

693
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,015
One...

694
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:46,318
Two...

695
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,745
Three...

696
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,354
To hell with the money.

697
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,522
Papa!

698
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,394
He's definitely a 100 percent blind!

699
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,265
Maria!

700
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,170
Get the vacuum!

701
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:23,103
Suck the ants from my pants!

702
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,508
Oh my, God!

703
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:32,281
Bitten!
- He 200 percent can't walk.

704
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:36,321
For sure papa's going
to test you as well.

705
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:39,327
He really can't walk,
that's why he passed the test.

706
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,761
Now you don't utter
a single word.

707
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,991
Not a single word should
come out of your mouth, get it?

708
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,157
"Pasta!"

709
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:48,723
Hello!

710
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:12,050
He cut me, threw me
and he shoved up my...!

711
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:13,712
<i>Mommy!</i>

712
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,455
"Bloody love..."

713
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:26,723
Teddy, what are you doing here?

714
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,259
Don't worry.

715
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,663
In this house, I am blind.

716
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:32,468
And I've convinced your papa as well.

717
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:34,269
And you convinced me as well...

718
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,072
...that there's no
such thing as astrology.

719
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,247
Nothing happened to papa.

720
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:41,079
Of course.

721
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:44,047
It's fixed for every person, you know.
- what?

722
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:45,678
Package.

723
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,656
Age... I mean papa's age.

724
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:49,678
Package.

725
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,082
Kids of a gun'?

726
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:53,161
- What?
- Son of a gun!

727
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:58,257
By the way, how's this top?

728
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:00,589
Teddy?

729
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,234
My sisters and my best friend Shirley
is getting married tomorrow.

730
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,001
We all have to go together.

731
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,039
That's fine my Jenifer Lopez.

732
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,602
But before that... how
about we rehearse for our wedding?

733
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,615
Teddy. Stop it!

734
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:16,409
"I'm gonna start the ignition..."

735
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,646
"...of you inner emotions."

736
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:21,082
"For manual operation
with mutual consideration

737
00:51:21,094 --> 00:51:23,748
for production of
future generation."

738
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:25,759
Shh.. Sandy, Teddy might heat you.

739
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:27,461
We're all in one house.

740
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:29,528
You keep spoiling my mood.

741
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:31,658
Hey ...what happened?

742
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,132
What happened?

743
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:38,039
I don't understand how
those two weirdos got in this house?

744
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:42,471
Duh! Hello... they both were
already in this Housefull.

745
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,569
You entered later.

746
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:47,581
So you better watch out for them.

747
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:52,484
But meanwhile, just keep watching me.

748
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:53,782
Understand?

749
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:56,589
Darling, under is fine,
but don't say stand.

750
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,453
Since I came in this house,
I've been only sitting.

751
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:01,485
It's been ages since I last stood up.

752
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:07,227
But tonight...
let's stone and roll, Sandy.

753
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,433
Stone, roll?

754
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:12,337
Let's rock and roll.

755
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:20,010
- Not on the lips?
- Not yet.

756
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:23,650
After we're married.

757
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,012
Wow, Sandy.

758
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:31,615
You proved today
that you really love me.

759
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:34,551
And you know the
best part about you is?

760
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:40,429
Even though you live here, those Indian
values and culture still exist in you.

761
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:42,162
My phone, hold on a second.

762
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:48,170
"I'll have to airlift
the Indians living in Kuwait."

763
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,871
"The Indians living in Kuwait... Indian."

764
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:56,646
He needs so much attention.

765
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,677
"London Bridge is falling down...
falling down... falling down."

766
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:04,692
"Come, let's get this party started,
party started, party started."

767
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,388
I'll call you back.

768
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:13,691
- Sandy?
- Not Sandy... Sundi.

769
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,434
And now you're going to be helpless...

770
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:22,306
...cause I am going to lock the door.

771
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:27,511
Jack... Lean on me!

772
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:32,316
- No, Sundi.
- Sandy! Sandy!

773
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:35,353
Yes, Sandy. Wait.
- Sandy! Sandy!

774
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:37,516
- No, Sundi.
- Sandy!

775
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,064
Sandy.

776
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:50,730
No.

777
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:57,171
- Soap!
- Oh my, God.

778
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:00,308
Where's a towel?

779
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,213
Help me.

780
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:10,723
Help me.

781
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:12,221
Help me.

782
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:12,759
Idea.

783
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:15,292
Sandy, fall asleep,
Sundi will sleep too.

784
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:17,023
- Good idea, good idea.
- Sleep.

785
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,031
'Rock-a-by baby..."

786
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:20,998
"Come to me my lady."

787
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:23,094
'Rock-a-by baby..."

788
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,436
"bowl of milk!"

789
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,635
- Help me!
- Help me!

790
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:35,545
Am I a doctor?

791
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,313
I am the one having bad luck.

792
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:46,416
One can't speak, one can't
see and the other one can't walk.

793
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,450
Good morning, Papa.

794
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:50,054
What's so good about it?

795
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:55,168
Come on, Batook. Let's exercise.

796
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,559
Good morning, Sandy!
- Good morning!

797
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:06,505
- Hey...
- what?

798
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:07,596
What?

799
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,642
Just now you were playing,
and now you're sitting.

800
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:14,308
This is leg-lines for papa,
and not headlines.

801
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:16,611
- Now you'll be feroze.
- Feroze.

802
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:18,586
I mean exposed.

803
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:22,317
Now the wealth will be
divided in only two parts.

804
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,414
What will tell papa?

805
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,091
That you're a liar.
You were playing football.

806
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,423
I saw it with my own eyes.

807
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:27,620
Yes, go tell him.

808
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:28,961
Go tell him that a blind
man was seeing with his eyes.

809
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:29,588
Go on.

810
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:30,963
Yes... I will tell him,
that I saw with my own...

811
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:33,024
- Yes, go tell him.
- Shit.

812
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:35,496
You bloody rascal...

813
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:37,003
Got the rhythm down pat..

814
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:37,595
Get ready!

815
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:39,231
About to hit the stage you raise..

816
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,406
Desi bad boi sharpin
in the razor blade..

817
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:41,534
Is the CD player on?

818
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:42,598
Got swag on lock..

819
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:43,702
Let em haters hate...

820
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,511
Got em thinking like man he great..
Down pat..

821
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:46,343
Get ready!

822
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:47,713
About to hit the stage you raise..

823
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,149
Desi bad boi sharpin
in the razor blade..

824
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:51,207
Got swag on lock..

825
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,585
Let em haters hate...
- Got em thinking like man he great..

826
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:54,054
You were right.

827
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:54,747
Make em say..

828
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:55,716
Right now just shake, shake..

829
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:56,553
Right now just shake, shake..

830
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:57,556
Right now just shake, shake..

831
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,992
Now the wealth will be divided in only two
parts. - Right now just shake, shake..

832
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:01,327
Come on, shoot that.
- Right now just shake, shake..

833
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:01,692
Kill em.

834
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,028
Who be the best on the mic..

835
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:03,962
Better tell em..

836
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,159
Right now just shake!

837
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:06,488
Kill em.

838
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,196
That... was total crap.

839
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,398
What?

840
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:14,601
"Your mother-sister...
Mother-sister... Mother-sister..."

841
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:20,068
Done?

842
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,605
Now, listen to your favorite song.

843
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,507
"Speak... speak... speak... Mr.Bachchan."

844
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,518
"Listen. What say Mr. Bachchan?"

845
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:28,681
"speak... speak... speak... Mr.Bachchan."

846
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:30,713
"Listen. What say Mr. Bachchan?"

847
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,780
"speak... speak... speak... Mr.Bachchan."

848
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:35,189
"we shot everything Bachchan."

849
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,500
Now... you're unmasked.

850
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:42,603
I mean papa... will come...
- And first watch...

851
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:50,637
...your single-screen
performance on this multiplex thing.

852
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:54,003
Speak... speak... speak... Mr.Bachchan."

853
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:56,039
"Listen. What say Mr. Bachchan?"

854
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:57,516
what do you two think?

855
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,714
Only you two can shoot a video?

856
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,049
Maria, have you seen my phone?

857
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,498
<i>I'm supposed to get an important call.</i>

858
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,597
Has anyone seen my phone?

859
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,200
Have you seen my stick, papa?

860
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:26,611
Get lost. I am supposed
to get an important call.

861
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:36,514
For our own good, we must
divide the wealth in three shares.

862
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,616
And instead of ruining each other...

863
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:42,564
...we should look out for each other.

864
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:46,724
Who says money divides?

865
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:53,396
The girls' money...
is going to make us rich.

866
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:36,416
"Expensive liners,
and those dangly earrings."

867
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:38,315
"The glittering skirt..."

868
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:40,252
"...and the way you sway
that waist is priceless."

869
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:43,723
"Expensive liners,
and those dangly earrings."

870
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,516
"The glittering skirt..."

871
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:47,575
"...and the way you sway
that waist is priceless."

872
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:51,030
"You make me skip a beat, sweetheart."

873
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:54,329
"You make me skip a beat, sweetheart."

874
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:57,234
"In this world..."

875
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:01,702
"You're the richest girl in London,
sweetheart."

876
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:05,338
"You're the richest girl in UK,
sweetheart."

877
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:10,509
"You're the richest girl in the world,
sweetheart."

878
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:30,168
"Handsome, dashing, smart
boys... they all want to be my man."

879
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:33,673
"You're the one who stole
the peace of my heart."

880
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:37,472
"when I walk, when I talk,
when I watch my sweetheart."

881
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:41,071
"There's no one else,
as gorgeous like you."

882
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,583
"I've said yes,
now take me along darling."

883
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,781
"I've said yes,
now take me along darling."

884
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:51,581
"In this London..."

885
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:55,356
"You're the richest guy in London,
darling."

886
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:59,094
"You're the richest guy in UK,
darling."

887
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:03,637
"You're the richest guy in the world,
darling."

888
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:07,030
"Your fair cheeks,
you black tresses."

889
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:08,541
"You look so sexy."

890
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:09,735
"Your gorgeous body..."

891
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,343
"Your gorgeous body, blows my mind."

892
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:14,346
"Your hot figure, blows my mind."

893
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:17,543
<i>" Anyone you trap,
only God can save him."</i>

894
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,415
"I've never seen anyone like you."

895
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:23,515
"Life is short,
let's say those sweet-nothings."

896
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:27,323
"If you say it once,
I'll do anything for you."

897
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,028
"This is your chance,
and also the ritual..."

898
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:31,054
"...but why you standing far."

899
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,567
"Take me in your arms,
like a true prince."

900
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:37,797
"Hello to everyone from me,
sweetheart."

901
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:42,066
"Hello to everyone from me,
sweetheart."

902
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:48,479
"In this world..."

903
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:52,542
"You're the richest girl in London,
darling."

904
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:56,284
"You're the richest girl in UK,
darling."

905
01:01:56,379 --> 01:02:01,021
"You're the richest
girl in the world, darling."

906
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:07,232
"You're the richest, girl."

907
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,531
"You're the richest, darling."

908
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:11,536
"You're the richest, girl."

909
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:14,733
"You're the richest, darling."

910
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:17,033
"You're the richest, girl."

911
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,443
"You're the richest, darling."

912
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:22,142
"You're the richest, darling."

913
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:26,243
"You're the richest, darling."

914
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:43,759
Yes.

915
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,461
Yes.

916
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:48,072
Yes... don't worry.

917
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:50,768
Your daughters Ganga, Jamuna,
Saraswati are absolutely fine.

918
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:56,041
Yes, yes the wedding
date has been fixed.

919
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:58,684
Okay.

920
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:10,192
Ganga, Jamuna, Saraswati are
not your daughters? - No.

921
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:13,229
And if you want to open
more franchises in London...

922
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:14,600
...then you must keep this a secret.

923
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,695
Okay... my lips are sealed.

924
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:19,434
But then who is their father?

925
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,438
Urja Nagre.

926
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:25,206
You mean that... that...
- Yes, him.

927
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:27,714
Once upon a time
Mumbai's most fierce Don.

928
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:30,047
- And I was his right-hand.
- You?

929
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:34,519
<i>Since the he used
to rule the city of Mumbai.</i>

930
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:20,998
What's this Shinde'? You planned
my assassination?

931
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:35,041
<i>Ruling the city of Mumbai...
and annihilating his enemies...</i>

932
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:37,744
<i>...was BHK for him.</i>

933
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:41,648
- BHK'?
- By left hand's play.

934
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:51,726
His principles were stronger
than his enemies' intentions.

935
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:58,365
Urja trafficking minor
girls is a very profitable business.

936
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:00,700
What do you say?

937
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,205
He was the Godfather...

938
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:14,176
...but an even better father
to his three daughters.

939
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:29,328
Due to the pressure built
up by raids and secret operations,

940
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:32,429
...by Maharashtra Police's the
Underworld has come to a stand-still.

941
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:35,008
Even big and powerful personalities...

942
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:38,308
...are either getting
arrested or fleeing.

943
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:44,514
'But just then... one of Urja
Nagre's enemies informed the police.

944
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:52,720
Come on!

945
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:55,228
Let my children go!

946
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:58,061
Let my daughters go!

947
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,261
Hey!

948
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:06,073
No! No!

949
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,409
Patel... Leave Mumbai and go to London.

950
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,715
I've got some property out there.

951
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:19,211
You've a clean record.

952
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,614
You'll be the caretaker
of my children.

953
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,219
You give them your name.

954
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:26,415
Raise them and get them married.

955
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,722
And give my wealth
to them and their husbands.

956
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:32,096
Did you get the bank papers?

957
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:39,034
But Patel... my daughters...

958
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:45,310
...should never know that
I am their real father.

959
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:55,454
Mother of the brownie cookies.

960
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,650
He's Ram... and you're Lakhan.

961
01:06:58,047 --> 01:07:00,027
- Yes.
- Papa-pia.

962
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:03,291
You took on the responsibility
of such a big man.

963
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:04,729
Wowwie.

964
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:06,660
But a thousand curses to the informer...

965
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,260
...that got Urja caught.

966
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:13,205
<i>He's a dog, he's a rascal... - Stop it.
How much are you going to abuse him'?</i>

967
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:16,606
You act like I am abusing you.

968
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,274
You're right.

969
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:22,274
I got Urja Nagre caught.

970
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,476
But you were his 'woof...
his loyal aide.

971
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:27,977
A man should be a traitor...

972
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,614
Even dogs are loyal.

973
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:31,487
All my life I've been lying.

974
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:34,620
I told my daughters that
marriages don't last in our family.

975
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:35,491
Lie.

976
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:37,725
Those predictions... also a lie.

977
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:41,696
The truth is... I always had
my eyes on Urja Nagre's wealth.

978
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,034
And that's why I want his three girls...

979
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:47,505
...to marry my three sons,
and not someone else.

980
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:50,010
You own sons? Who?

981
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:52,308
Same guys who were released
from jail yesterday.

982
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:53,540
My boys.

983
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:32,415
No one has the guts...
to stop us now.

984
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:37,321
No one has the guts...
to stop us now... until the wedding.

985
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:58,626
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

986
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:00,578
INDIAN.

987
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,107
I don't believe it.

988
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:05,942
This one word... India...
- Don't say it.

989
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,416
<i>- Quiet.
- Sorry.</i>

990
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,616
I mean... when you hear this one word,
you turn into Sundi'?

991
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:15,487
Is this a lifetime illness?
- Only four days!

992
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,624
Four days later,
after we're married...

993
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:20,962
...I will be cured.

994
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,593
I'll have money... no depression.

995
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:24,092
Set.

996
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:40,548
I've a huge treasure-chest
waiting for you...

997
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:43,488
...but you three are busy
stealing pennies and dimes.

998
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:46,584
Dad... a tailor's son...

999
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:48,329
...is going to stitch
clothes for a living.

1000
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:49,758
Crime runs in our blood.

1001
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:50,724
True.

1002
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:53,398
The main agenda is to stop

1003
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:57,265
...those blind, mute and crippled
guys from marrying the girls.

1004
01:09:57,459 --> 01:09:59,496
The easiest way out of this problem...

1005
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:04,511
...is that we take those
three someplace and shoot them.

1006
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:08,276
Wonderful. Shoot! Murder!

1007
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:12,048
A dog's tail will always stay crooked.

1008
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,085
Try to understand
the important point here.

1009
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:17,121
If your lentils gets spoiled,
your day is spoiled.

1010
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:19,555
If your pickle gets spoiled,
the whole year is spoiled.

1011
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:21,059
- What?
- What what?

1012
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:22,116
Shut up.

1013
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:26,598
The main point here is
that your father's still here.

1014
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,204
I will find a way out of this.

1015
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:32,637
Dad, you don't dig
a well when there's a fire.

1016
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:34,368
Try to understand our point.

1017
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:36,410
You've made a very simple plan.

1018
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:38,035
But it's a sure-shot plan.

1019
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:42,409
A person should be simple.

1020
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:45,475
Because... even VIP
is an underwear brand.

1021
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,155
Did you get a word what he said?
- Nah!

1022
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,785
Whatever.

1023
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:56,654
Bunty, you know Batook's dog...

1024
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:59,789
I mean his daughter.
- what crap do you keep saying?

1025
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:03,264
You know I've so many dreams
to fulfill once I marry her.

1026
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:04,429
I see... tell me.

1027
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:07,667
Once I get the money,
I'll sponsor a car for myself...

1028
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:10,671
...and become Grand
Prix's top Indian racer.

1029
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:12,144
Indian.

1030
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:15,614
Even I'll use my money
to make a music album...

1031
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:18,481
...and it will be the best
Indian album in the world.

1032
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,518
My songs will be played
in the Indian Premier League.

1033
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:21,680
India Pro-Kabaddi League.

1034
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:23,746
Now it will be an Indian wedding.

1035
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:25,048
What the!

1036
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:31,524
Sundi is back!

1037
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:35,395
I am going to Batook Patel.

1038
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:40,129
To expose you, you... and Sandy.

1039
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:43,201
Stop me if you can.

1040
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:46,538
I will expose you all!

1041
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:47,808
We must stop him.

1042
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:50,104
- Come on.
- Come on.

1043
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:06,391
I am coming, Batook!

1044
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:25,606
Pakistani.

1045
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:29,215
- Pakistani.
- What are you doing?

1046
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:31,348
If Sundi can come out hearing Indian...

1047
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:34,189
...then maybe he can go back
hearing Pakistani. - Yes.

1048
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:37,091
- Pakistani.
- Iraqi.

1049
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:38,527
- Afghani.
- Kuwaiti.

1050
01:12:38,587 --> 01:12:40,589
- Dubai.
- Nepali.

1051
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:43,737
No country can stop Sundi today.

1052
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,810
Not countries, But now
these two states will stop Sundi.

1053
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:54,712
- UP...
- And Maharashtra.

1054
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:58,706
Hey!

1055
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:13,488
Catch him!

1056
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:17,566
Spin!

1057
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:39,390
He's fallen. Bunty, catch him.

1058
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,291
Not me, catch him.

1059
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:45,161
You sure did eat a lot.

1060
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:13,618
Why you..

1061
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:18,590
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Why you!

1062
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:23,464
- You dog...
- Sorry, sorry...

1063
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:45,691
Now there's just one way to stop him.

1064
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:48,591
Break his legs for real.

1065
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:03,669
Careful!

1066
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,579
You guys can't hurt Sundi.

1067
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:20,454
Sundi will hurt himself.

1068
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:29,460
Batook, where are you?

1069
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:31,993
Let's go, quickly.

1070
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,577
Batook, look at my legs.

1071
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:08,975
Papa, he's sitting down only.

1072
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:12,538
Hickory, Dickory... and Dock.

1073
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:14,379
I can walk...

1074
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:17,610
...and this rascal... can talk.

1075
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,013
Cheating.

1076
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,180
Yes, cheating.

1077
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:26,390
These cheaters have
played hide and skirt..

1078
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:29,622
I mean hide and seek papa.

1079
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:33,330
I am blind,
but couldn't you see it papa?

1080
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:41,607
- Come blind one.

1081
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:43,504
What?

1082
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:45,376
You think if I catch the
ball you'll prove I am not blind?

1083
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,344
I am blind.

1084
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:47,607
I am blind, papa.

1085
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:55,615
Take that!

1086
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:57,487
What?

1087
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,025
You think if I catch the brick
you'll prove I am not blind.

1088
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:01,459
I am blind.

1089
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,529
I am blind, papa.

1090
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:14,365
I am not blind.

1091
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:15,429
- He caught it.
- Yes.

1092
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:16,636
I am not blind.

1093
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:18,541
Open your eyes and
take a look, Batook.

1094
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,139
We're exposed.

1095
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:24,176
Throw us out of the house.

1096
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:28,180
You can even slap us with these hands...

1097
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:32,717
Sandy, what did you Sundi do?

1098
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:36,490
OMG... what the?

1099
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:39,655
You guys ruined papa's wax statue.

1100
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:41,759
Gosh!

1101
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:43,563
Good Lord.

1102
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:45,662
How are you going to fix this, Jenny?

1103
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:48,097
What happened?

1104
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:51,406
Congratulations, guys.
It was a wax statue.

1105
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:54,748
And we thought... it was dad.

1106
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:58,608
But seriously guys,
are you guys walnuts?

1107
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,551
- Walnuts?
- Are you guys nuts?

1108
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:01,679
Oh...

1109
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:04,021
The whole hand is disfigured.

1110
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:07,459
We want to gift this to
papa next week on his birthday.

1111
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,462
- Sorry. Really sorry.
- Sorry.

1112
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,598
Oh yes, why don't we
go fix your broken wheelchair.

1113
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:15,465
Yes. Let's go fix that
before her father returns.

1114
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:16,634
Come, Bubbly... I mean, Bunty.

1115
01:18:16,658 --> 01:18:17,329
We'll be right back.

1116
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:19,338
Fix your father's hand,
and we'll be right back.

1117
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:21,030
They don't understand.
- Hurry up.

1118
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:22,301
It's not about the wax...

1119
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:24,499
...it's about our feelings for papa.

1120
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:26,607
You're right Jenny.

1121
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:31,182
Whatever we are today,
it's only because of our dad.

1122
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,634
Yes, Shafiq, I saw your missed call.

1123
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:58,271
I was driving.

1124
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,339
I went to pee, and you sat down.

1125
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,081
I was only checking
whether it's working or not.

1126
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:04,049
No need to get angry.

1127
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:05,608
It's so cute, isn't it?...

1128
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:08,034
I see... so you were eyeing those two.
- Yeah, it's amazing.

1129
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:12,617
Ogling at girls from
behind the glasses.

1130
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:15,056
So what are you doing tonight?

1131
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:18,029
I don't know,
I was thinking to maybe go out.

1132
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:19,293
Not sure, what about you?

1133
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:25,037
Hey baby, let's go for a ride.
- Oh my, God. Get off me.

1134
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:30,301
Take it easy, guys.

1135
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:42,745
Now like this gun,
you guys will RIP.

1136
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:45,048
Rest... In... Pieces!

1137
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:50,463
Isn't... that Urja Nagre?

1138
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,660
<i>Mumbai's Don?</i>

1139
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:58,036
But wasn't he in jail?

1140
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:01,267
Don't ever think of doing
this... in your wildest dreams.

1141
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:08,305
Hold it guys, hold it.

1142
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:09,508
Please hold it.

1143
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:12,550
I would appreciate if you
guys had taken a slight effort...

1144
01:20:12,574 --> 01:20:14,576
...to stop these goons.

1145
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:18,555
We should use our hands for a cause,
not just applause.

1146
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:22,452
Please leave, guys. Please.

1147
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,324
Come on, come on.

1148
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:27,458
Come on, let's leave.

1149
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:28,694
And you three.

1150
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:30,991
You guys look like your from India.

1151
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,634
Thank God he didn't say Indian.

1152
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:34,696
What did you say?

1153
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:37,573
You three should be ashamed.

1154
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:39,399
Those goons were
harassing those girls...

1155
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:40,678
...and you three were simply watching.

1156
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:43,308
But we poor guys are disabled.

1157
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,815
- I...
- You're crippled.

1158
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:47,074
He's mute.

1159
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:48,781
And... I am blind.

1160
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:05,569
Get something to eat.

1161
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:08,406
We'll split this in dues ways.
- Give it to me.

1162
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:11,172
Hey... what's going on'?

1163
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:14,044
- Flies.
- Flies are bothering us.

1164
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:15,240
- Flies.

1165
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,651
What's Nagre doing in London?

1166
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:30,424
If he's in London, that means
someone's surely going to die.

1167
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:34,565
"Take some rice, and some
lentil and top it off with curd."

1168
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:38,193
"One who harbors no enmity,
is the happiest person on this earth..."

1169
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:42,764
A... T... M!

1170
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:45,101
Any Time Money?

1171
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:49,706
Today I'm going to beat you.

1172
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:54,250
Urja. You're in London?

1173
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:57,050
When did you come out from jail,
Urja?

1174
01:21:57,779 --> 01:22:00,350
Seeing my good behavior,
the government...

1175
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:02,452
...pardoned the rest of my sentence.

1176
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:04,429
After getting released from jail...

1177
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:06,326
...I thought of coming
here and surprising you.

1178
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:09,358
And to see my daughters once.

1179
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:12,628
Not like a father, but as a stranger.

1180
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:14,733
But just see them.

1181
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:19,202
But Shafiq called
before I could call you.

1182
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:21,508
That arms dealer from London.

1183
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:26,211
He informed me... that you're
getting my daughters married...

1184
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:31,084
...to some guys who are not normal.

1185
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:33,223
What?

1186
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:34,487
What did I say?

1187
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:35,619
What did I say?

1188
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:40,332
My daughters should never
know what tears ate.

1189
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:42,428
Didn't I say that?

1190
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:45,434
Is that all you know?
- what do you mean?

1191
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:46,602
What do you mean?

1192
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:51,201
I had chosen dues
capable and normal boys.

1193
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:55,042
That's why I called you
to say there's a wedding at home.

1194
01:22:55,103 --> 01:22:56,377
But then I found out that...

1195
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:59,351
...the boys you. I daughters
love are not normal.

1196
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:01,679
I tried explaining the girls.

1197
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:04,587
I said "Please don't marry Teddy,
Bunty and Sandy".

1198
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:08,594
But for you daughters,
love is blind, love is mute...

1199
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,391
...and love is crippled!

1200
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:14,190
This is how I'm
rewarded for my loyalty?

1201
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:22,599
Sorry, Patel. Sorry.

1202
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:25,267
I am a father after all.

1203
01:23:26,067 --> 01:23:33,281
But Patel, I must see what's
right and what's not for my daughters.

1204
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:38,122
Tell me... where will I find
those normal boys for my daughters?

1205
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:44,320
You will... I'll show you.

1206
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:57,504
He's an expert in
transporting people upstairs.

1207
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:01,680
He... satisfies his hunger
by feeding others.

1208
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:08,588
And he... cleans 250,000 shoes every day.

1209
01:24:11,112 --> 01:24:13,092
These are the three boys.

1210
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:17,495
And Urja, I forgot
to tell you one important detail.

1211
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:20,097
All three boys are orphans.

1212
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:22,564
No, Patel, they are not orphans.

1213
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:24,493
They are like Kohinoor diamonds.

1214
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:25,503
What diamonds?

1215
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,164
Human beings should
be like human beings.

1216
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:29,139
Even a rice brand is called Kohinoor.

1217
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:33,577
Patel, my daughters
will marry these three boys only.

1218
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:35,275
When are those three
boys getting married?

1219
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:36,441
Saturday.

1220
01:24:36,538 --> 01:24:39,610
You mean... WTF.

1221
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:41,316
What the...

1222
01:24:41,643 --> 01:24:44,419
Wednesday... Thursday... Friday!

1223
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:47,753
We have three days
to stop their marriage.

1224
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:49,627
This looks stunning.
- Look at it, Gracy.

1225
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:50,391
It's really beautiful.

1226
01:24:50,452 --> 01:24:51,226
Isn't it?

1227
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:52,396
Oh, look at that,
that's really pretty.

1228
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,093
"You're the richest
of all sweetheart."

1229
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:55,691
"You're the richest
of all sweetheart."

1230
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:58,169
"You're the richest
of all sweetheart."

1231
01:24:58,226 --> 01:25:01,173
"You're the richest
of all sweetheart."

1232
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:04,301
Girls, why do we love these losers?

1233
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:06,174
"You're the richest
of all sweetheart."

1234
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:07,338
Because...

1235
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:10,076
- we're so crazy about them.
- Yeah.

1236
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:34,202
"And I found love... when I found you."

1237
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:44,731
"Because I need you...
when I say I love you."

1238
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:51,688
"And I found love..."

1239
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:56,786
"Oh baby, please stay."

1240
01:25:57,452 --> 01:26:02,452
"I need you... when I say I love you."

1241
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:38,030
Hello. Enough decoration for the day.

1242
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:39,194
It all looks beautiful.

1243
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:41,272
Batook sir, you're going
to wear this for the wedding.

1244
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:42,536
Yes, Maria, it's fine.

1245
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:44,270
I won't let this wedding happen!

1246
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:46,567
Who is he?

1247
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:05,657
Urja! The don has come.

1248
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,631
Don! Don! Don! Hide.

1249
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:09,635
- Dead for sure.
- Who? Papa?

1250
01:27:09,691 --> 01:27:12,137
- No, us.
- Why?

1251
01:27:12,193 --> 01:27:15,663
I am mute for your papa,
but for Urja Nagre I am crippled!

1252
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:19,337
I am crippled for your papa,
but for Urja Nagre I am blind.

1253
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:22,472
I am blind for your papa,
but for Urja Nagre I am nude.

1254
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:25,108
You're mute, how can you be nude?

1255
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:28,619
Then you three should stay away
from the lemon's light. - Yeah.

1256
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:29,747
Lemon's light?

1257
01:27:30,044 --> 01:27:31,455
What does you girl keep saying?

1258
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:33,082
She's saying limelight.

1259
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:35,218
Nimbu means lime, Roshni means light.

1260
01:27:35,283 --> 01:27:36,523
What else?

1261
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:37,392
But how?

1262
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:39,728
Idea. Cover your
faces the bead strings.

1263
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:50,474
Urja, Urja... what are you doing here?

1264
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:52,736
Before I went to jail,
I had loaned you some money.

1265
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:54,621
You thought I'll
never get out of jail?

1266
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:56,856
Here you're busy preparing
for you daughters weddings.

1267
01:27:57,305 --> 01:27:59,376
For the world you are good

1268
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:01,447
but for me you're a traitor.

1269
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:04,484
Pay up... or I won'!
Let this wedding happen.

1270
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,184
- Mister.
- What?

1271
01:28:07,682 --> 01:28:08,990
How much does he owe?

1272
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:11,223
One million, five million...

1273
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:13,460
10 million... 50 million?

1274
01:28:13,655 --> 01:28:14,655
Papa will pay it back.

1275
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:18,637
With interest,
he owes me 50 billion.

1276
01:28:19,694 --> 01:28:21,469
Oh my. God!

1277
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:24,133
Papa, that kind of money
one borrows for the entire country...

1278
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:25,639
...and not for yourself.

1279
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:26,735
Quiet!

1280
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:29,345
Urja I'll be out on the streets.

1281
01:28:29,404 --> 01:28:31,077
And we'll be flat-bloke.

1282
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:36,384
I'm begging you,
don't tarnish my honor.

1283
01:28:36,444 --> 01:28:37,548
Forgive me.

1284
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:42,323
- You guys beg him too.
- Yes...

1285
01:28:42,383 --> 01:28:43,191
Come quickly.

1286
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:44,251
Help me.

1287
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:49,293
Come on, quickly.

1288
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:50,358
Yes.

1289
01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:52,166
Everyone take their turban off.

1290
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:53,534
- Urja.
- Say sorry.

1291
01:28:53,594 --> 01:28:54,595
Sorry...

1292
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:55,662
Sorry...

1293
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:01,010
Urja, take pity on these mute,
crippled and blind guys.

1294
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:02,589
He'll see our faces.
- Hide your faces.

1295
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:05,310
Look at their innocent faces.

1296
01:29:05,373 --> 01:29:07,080
Show him your faces.

1297
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:08,586
Show it! Show it!

1298
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:14,993
It's hand to make out who's blind,
mute or crippled.

1299
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:18,129
Aren't you the same
guys I gave money to?

1300
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,196
I'll forgive you on one condition.

1301
01:29:20,254 --> 01:29:21,255
What condition?

1302
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:22,694
Marriage.

1303
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:24,560
You want to marry Batook?

1304
01:29:26,294 --> 01:29:30,106
Not me... my dues sons have
been waiting to get married

1305
01:29:30,398 --> 01:29:32,173
to Batook's daughters.

1306
01:29:33,434 --> 01:29:36,142
Let me call my sons.
My three tigers.

1307
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:38,616
<i>Rohan. Rishi. Rajeev.</i>

1308
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:40,152
Look straight blind one.

1309
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:56,133
Papa...
- Yes. - Yes.

1310
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:57,430
I was talking to Batook.

1311
01:29:57,492 --> 01:29:58,061
Say yes.

1312
01:29:58,126 --> 01:29:59,126
Say yes.

1313
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:02,105
If we get married,
what about you heart attack?

1314
01:30:02,163 --> 01:30:03,506
What about your predictions?

1315
01:30:03,765 --> 01:30:06,268
I owe him 50 billion.

1316
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:10,043
I'll have no future if I don't pay up,
so what will I do with the predictions?

1317
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:12,414
Dad...
- Yes... - Yes.

1318
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:14,248
I was talking to Urja sir.

1319
01:30:14,308 --> 01:30:15,616
- Say yes.
- Yes.

1320
01:30:15,676 --> 01:30:17,519
Can we adorn the rings right here?

1321
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:20,184
Yes, with you blessings,
we can do it now?

1322
01:30:21,482 --> 01:30:25,521
Mister... can we get some
time to repay the loan?

1323
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:27,755
Fine.

1324
01:30:28,322 --> 01:30:29,699
- 10...
- Months.

1325
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:30,292
<i>That's a lot of time.</i>

1326
01:30:30,358 --> 01:30:34,534
- 9... 8... 7... 6...
- Cheating.

1327
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:35,198
5...

1328
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:36,263
Sir...

1329
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:41,505
Sir... at least give them
10 days to repay the loan.

1330
01:30:41,736 --> 01:30:43,147
Please say yes, sir.

1331
01:30:43,204 --> 01:30:45,377
- Please say yes, sir!
- Fine.

1332
01:30:45,706 --> 01:30:48,482
I'll give them a chance
to repay the loan.

1333
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:51,319
But now... we'll stay with them.

1334
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:56,328
Patel... for the next ten days,
you house is full.

1335
01:30:57,385 --> 01:30:58,523
Bloody dog.

1336
01:30:58,586 --> 01:31:00,395
Watch where you fall.

1337
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:04,535
Hello Urja.

1338
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:07,368
Patel, I've been
washed out before in life.

1339
01:31:07,428 --> 01:31:10,500
Betrayed?
- I mean apples, grapes...

1340
01:31:10,565 --> 01:31:12,044
I've washed them before I ate them.

1341
01:31:12,099 --> 01:31:13,744
They're all clean, right?
- Yes, of course.

1342
01:31:13,768 --> 01:31:16,044
A person should always be clean...

1343
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:17,703
...even the movie is
named Dirty Picture.

1344
01:31:19,106 --> 01:31:20,585
Vidya Balan's... you didn't see it.?

1345
01:31:22,743 --> 01:31:26,190
Patel, I was thinking...

1346
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:06,595
This '50 billion plan'
benefited you the most. Right?

1347
01:32:07,288 --> 01:32:10,167
Years later you finally
got your chance.

1348
01:32:11,225 --> 01:32:14,263
Patel, a drop can't quench
the thirst of the ocean.

1349
01:32:14,328 --> 01:32:17,172
How can I quench this
18 year old thirst in 10 days'?

1350
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:22,476
Batook, I hope these days go ASAP.
- As soon as possible?

1351
01:32:23,504 --> 01:32:26,485
As slow as possible. Slowly.

1352
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:32,753
But Patel, whatever I went through
is because of that one man.

1353
01:32:33,347 --> 01:32:34,758
The one who got me arrested.

1354
01:32:35,082 --> 01:32:38,256
The day I find out
who that traitor is...

1355
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:40,799
...he will DIE by my hands.

1356
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:43,763
- Full form?
- No full form.

1357
01:32:44,325 --> 01:32:46,168
He will die!

1358
01:32:58,306 --> 01:32:59,580
Come Urja.

1359
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:04,213
You said you want to
keep an eye on them 24/7.

1360
01:33:04,278 --> 01:33:05,723
So I called everyone.

1361
01:33:06,013 --> 01:33:07,549
We'll have dinner together.

1362
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:09,082
Start.

1363
01:33:11,752 --> 01:33:12,752
Thanks.

1364
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:17,732
Margret, get the rice.

1365
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:25,600
Let me get that for you.
- You're blind too, remember.

1366
01:33:32,139 --> 01:33:33,140
What happened?

1367
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:36,214
Nothing, it was hurting.

1368
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:53,126
Teddy.

1369
01:33:53,361 --> 01:33:54,704
If you don't mind me asking...

1370
01:33:55,096 --> 01:33:58,566
No offense, but... how did
this incident happen to you'?

1371
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,646
' I'm blind and mute.
What do I say now?'

1372
01:34:06,507 --> 01:34:08,509
Once on the clock...

1373
01:34:10,511 --> 01:34:12,320
No! Guys, guys...

1374
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:14,621
I mean once upon a time.

1375
01:34:17,184 --> 01:34:20,165
Teddy was giving his practical
exams at the chemistry lab.

1376
01:34:20,221 --> 01:34:24,601
And by mistake...
some acid fell in his eyes.

1377
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:26,232
It pained so much...

1378
01:34:26,293 --> 01:34:28,170
...that he cried really loud all day.

1379
01:34:32,133 --> 01:34:36,104
'I see... acid in his eyes...
that's why he went blind.'

1380
01:34:36,771 --> 01:34:39,411
'I see... he lost his voice
because he cried out loud so much.'

1381
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:43,779
And what happened with you, Sandy?

1382
01:34:49,784 --> 01:34:51,661
Behind the long clock...

1383
01:34:54,622 --> 01:34:58,399
Guys... long time back.

1384
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:02,470
He met with an accident...

1385
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:04,134
...while clicking a
photo on a terrace.

1386
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:06,705
'Went blind taking pictures?"

1387
01:35:07,001 --> 01:35:09,003
'Became crippled taking pictures?"

1388
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:12,347
Because... the poor guy was holding
the camera backwards.

1389
01:35:12,406 --> 01:35:13,650
The camera flashed in his eyes...

1390
01:35:13,674 --> 01:35:16,018
...and he fell down from the terrace.

1391
01:35:18,612 --> 01:35:19,488
'I see...'

1392
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:21,390
'He went blind because of the flash.'

1393
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:24,760
'He became crippled due
to falling from the terrace.'

1394
01:35:26,587 --> 01:35:29,124
You guys told us about these two.

1395
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:33,331
But what is Bunty's story?

1396
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:35,435
Why don't you tell us, mister?

1397
01:35:35,763 --> 01:35:37,743
Or will someone else tell us?

1398
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:42,438
'She will save me.'

1399
01:35:46,173 --> 01:35:47,447
The clock stopped.

1400
01:35:50,111 --> 01:35:53,217
Hey guys... time stopped.

1401
01:35:55,216 --> 01:35:56,696
When I got the news that some goon...

1402
01:35:57,151 --> 01:36:03,568
Some goon shot him with a knife.

1403
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:08,505
I picked him up in a hospital...
and took him to the ambulance.

1404
01:36:08,729 --> 01:36:12,074
This crazy girl is
going to get me killed.'

1405
01:36:12,133 --> 01:36:14,739
But there... his father got his mother.

1406
01:36:15,402 --> 01:36:19,441
But his mother didn't get his father.

1407
01:36:19,507 --> 01:36:21,316
What nonsense are you saying?

1408
01:36:23,477 --> 01:36:24,615
Don't hide it.

1409
01:36:25,012 --> 01:36:27,083
Don't hide anything from them.

1410
01:36:27,148 --> 01:36:29,355
If you can't say it, then let me.

1411
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:30,451
I'll tell them.

1412
01:36:30,518 --> 01:36:34,398
This happened when he was still...
in his mother's womb.

1413
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:36,560
Like a Cowboy's lasso,
the umbilical chord...

1414
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:39,298
...wrapped around his neck first,
and then his legs.

1415
01:36:39,593 --> 01:36:41,698
And you all know what
happened with him next?

1416
01:36:41,762 --> 01:36:44,504
What makes me sad is that...

1417
01:36:45,533 --> 01:36:47,740
...you called us handicapped
guys at the dining table...

1418
01:36:48,369 --> 01:36:51,646
...and want to heat stories
about how we became handicapped!

1419
01:36:52,072 --> 01:36:54,575
If you want to hear stories,
then I'll tell you one.

1420
01:36:55,342 --> 01:36:58,323
I had a friend, Ashok Fitnis.

1421
01:36:58,779 --> 01:37:03,091
Poor guy didn't have both arms,
both legs, one eye...

1422
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:05,427
...and he had just one hobby.

1423
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:08,256
To travel.

1424
01:37:08,455 --> 01:37:12,426
His family once took
him to Mahabaleshwar...

1425
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:13,995
...in a plastic bag.

1426
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:18,634
While showing him the valleys,
the bag tore...

1427
01:37:18,699 --> 01:37:20,542
...and he fell in the valley.

1428
01:37:20,734 --> 01:37:24,011
And he was no more.

1429
01:37:24,705 --> 01:37:27,481
I'll tell you all more stories.
- Enough! Enough!

1430
01:37:27,608 --> 01:37:30,350
What kind of stories is he telling?
- Enough.

1431
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:31,521
They are getting very emotional.

1432
01:37:31,545 --> 01:37:33,123
How much salt are you going
to throw on our wounds - Please.

1433
01:37:33,147 --> 01:37:35,392
You've emptied the entire shaker already?
- Come.. Let's go girls.

1434
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:38,295
Please... let's give them some space.
- Listen... listen to my story.

1435
01:37:38,352 --> 01:37:40,059
Listen!

1436
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:46,297
We're in deep trouble.

1437
01:37:46,493 --> 01:37:48,473
We've only 10 days...
- 9!

1438
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:52,306
Now we must pay
50 billion in <i>9</i> days.

1439
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:53,443
And on top of this, that Rohan...

1440
01:37:53,467 --> 01:37:55,312
He was touching my sister-in-law
in all the wrong places.

1441
01:37:55,336 --> 01:37:57,338
I am very panty about her.
- what?

1442
01:37:57,404 --> 01:37:59,179
<i>I mean senti about her.</i>

1443
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,378
Shut up you two.

1444
01:38:00,574 --> 01:38:04,351
What can two cripples, two blind
and two mute guys do in this house?

1445
01:38:04,645 --> 01:38:05,645
<i>Shit.</i>

1446
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:07,317
There's a lot we can do.

1447
01:38:08,315 --> 01:38:09,453
I have a plan.

1448
01:38:12,086 --> 01:38:13,224
Who's out there?

1449
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:18,399
Urja, you're still awake.

1450
01:38:21,128 --> 01:38:21,629
Both of them are coming.

1451
01:38:21,695 --> 01:38:22,775
Who's blind, who's mute?...

1452
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:23,599
I...

1453
01:38:23,664 --> 01:38:24,574
Give me the cane.

1454
01:38:24,632 --> 01:38:25,736
He's crippled not me.

1455
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:28,111
What's up?

1456
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:48,327
What are you guys doing?

1457
01:38:48,389 --> 01:38:50,596
It's 'Janmastami'
(Indian Festival) in India.

1458
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:53,332
And this is the only
way we can celebrate it.

1459
01:38:53,394 --> 01:38:54,634
"Gopala below."

1460
01:38:54,728 --> 01:38:56,139
"Gopala in the middle."

1461
01:38:56,196 --> 01:38:58,733
"And Gopala on the top."

1462
01:39:00,067 --> 01:39:05,073
'There's a commotion all over town."

1463
01:39:05,139 --> 01:39:07,312
"Here comes Krishna of Brij..."

1464
01:39:07,374 --> 01:39:10,651
"...take care of your pots."

1465
01:39:10,711 --> 01:39:13,055
" Govinda!"

1466
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:18,529
<i>Guys... guys...</i>

1467
01:39:18,652 --> 01:39:19,652
Guys...

1468
01:39:20,187 --> 01:39:21,257
Guys, please.

1469
01:39:21,555 --> 01:39:22,590
Please... guys.

1470
01:39:22,656 --> 01:39:23,157
Listen...

1471
01:39:23,223 --> 01:39:24,258
what's the plan?

1472
01:39:25,459 --> 01:39:27,200
Guys. Guys.

1473
01:39:27,261 --> 01:39:29,332
Guys, listen to me!

1474
01:39:31,298 --> 01:39:33,107
We've come up with a plan.

1475
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,639
It will clean the debt...

1476
01:39:36,070 --> 01:39:37,950
...and get those there villain
out of our lives.

1477
01:39:38,138 --> 01:39:41,551
Jenny, tomorrow is the St.
Patrick's Beer Festival at wembley.

1478
01:39:41,608 --> 01:39:44,316
We'll call Urja's boys
there and get them drunk.

1479
01:39:44,378 --> 01:39:46,483
And as soon as we get out chance,
we'll reward them.

1480
01:39:46,547 --> 01:39:47,389
Meaning?

1481
01:39:47,448 --> 01:39:49,758
<i>Meaning Rajeev, Rohan and Rishi...</i>

1482
01:39:50,184 --> 01:39:54,291
You all have got to sleep with them.

1483
01:39:54,355 --> 01:39:55,095
What?

1484
01:39:55,155 --> 01:39:56,361
I mean seduce them.

1485
01:39:56,423 --> 01:39:57,766
- Listen to me.
- No way.

1486
01:39:58,058 --> 01:39:59,093
It's really simple...

1487
01:39:59,159 --> 01:40:00,263
why did you slap me?

1488
01:40:00,294 --> 01:40:01,432
You're always hitting me.

1489
01:40:01,462 --> 01:40:02,566
Listen to me!

1490
01:40:40,601 --> 01:40:45,380
"We're going to dance all night..."

1491
01:40:49,343 --> 01:40:51,380
"we're going to dance all night..."

1492
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:53,322
"...with our feet in the air."

1493
01:41:00,287 --> 01:41:03,097
"we're going to dance all night..."

1494
01:41:03,157 --> 01:41:05,000
"...with our feet in the air."

1495
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:07,039
"Everyone drunk today..."

1496
01:41:07,094 --> 01:41:08,698
"...with our feet in the air."

1497
01:41:08,762 --> 01:41:12,471
"Switch off the lights... tom,
dick and harry."

1498
01:41:12,533 --> 01:41:16,413
"Steal this moment,
don't think you silly."

1499
01:41:16,603 --> 01:41:18,640
"Every part of your
body's going to rock..."

1500
01:41:18,705 --> 01:41:20,480
"...with our feet in the air."

1501
01:41:20,774 --> 01:41:22,549
"we're going to dance all night..."

1502
01:41:22,609 --> 01:41:24,555
"...with our feet in the air."

1503
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:45,732
"I am a bottle of wine..."

1504
01:41:45,799 --> 01:41:47,710
"...that's completely intoxicating."

1505
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:51,545
"All the guys want a piece of me."

1506
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:53,607
"I am cutie-cutie..."

1507
01:41:53,674 --> 01:41:55,585
"And a little naughty."

1508
01:41:55,642 --> 01:41:59,146
"You and me have a great chemistry."

1509
01:41:59,213 --> 01:42:01,454
"You're divine baby."

1510
01:42:01,515 --> 01:42:03,426
"Always hitting on me, baby."

1511
01:42:03,484 --> 01:42:07,261
"I feel so fine, fine, fine."

1512
01:42:07,521 --> 01:42:11,196
"Let's dance like Govinda..."

1513
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:17,338
"Let's dance like Govinda..."

1514
01:42:17,397 --> 01:42:19,343
"...with our feet in the air."

1515
01:42:19,399 --> 01:42:21,345
"Let's dance like Govinda..."

1516
01:42:21,401 --> 01:42:23,278
"...with our feet in the air."

1517
01:42:23,337 --> 01:42:25,283
"Everyone drunk today..."

1518
01:42:25,339 --> 01:42:27,341
"...with our feet in the air."

1519
01:43:05,746 --> 01:43:07,282
"Don't stop me."

1520
01:43:07,981 --> 01:43:09,255
"I want to dance."

1521
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:11,694
"Put up your hand,
the music's playing loud."

1522
01:43:11,718 --> 01:43:13,664
"I am going to dance all night."

1523
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,165
"Don't stop me."

1524
01:43:15,656 --> 01:43:17,101
"I want to dance."

1525
01:43:17,658 --> 01:43:19,638
"Put up your hand,
the music's playing loud."

1526
01:43:19,693 --> 01:43:22,037
"I am going to dance all night."

1527
01:43:22,095 --> 01:43:23,768
"The place is houseful..."

1528
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:25,738
"...DJ raise the sound."

1529
01:43:25,999 --> 01:43:29,412
"Sway that waist all you like."

1530
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:33,345
"Let's shake that waist..."

1531
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:39,589
"Let's shake that waist..."

1532
01:43:39,646 --> 01:43:41,455
"...with our feet in the air."

1533
01:43:41,515 --> 01:43:43,461
"Let's shake that waist..."

1534
01:43:43,517 --> 01:43:45,394
"...with our feet in the air."

1535
01:43:45,452 --> 01:43:49,332
"Switch off the lights... tom,
dick and harry."

1536
01:43:49,389 --> 01:43:53,132
"Steal this moment,
don't think you silly."

1537
01:43:53,193 --> 01:43:55,298
"Every part of your
body's going to rock..."

1538
01:43:55,362 --> 01:43:57,205
"...with our feet in the air."

1539
01:43:57,264 --> 01:43:59,175
"we're going to dance all night..."

1540
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:01,076
"...with our feet in the air."

1541
01:44:01,134 --> 01:44:03,637
"we're going to dance all night..."

1542
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:06,745
"...with our feet in the air."

1543
01:44:07,007 --> 01:44:08,748
"we're going to dance all night..."

1544
01:44:09,009 --> 01:44:11,011
"...with our feet in the air."

1545
01:44:35,035 --> 01:44:37,311
would you guys like
something to drink? No?

1546
01:44:38,038 --> 01:44:40,746
Margret, get me some kokum juice.

1547
01:44:41,708 --> 01:44:43,710
We found some good boys.
- Didn't I tell you so?

1548
01:44:43,777 --> 01:44:45,723
Guys, next monsoon...

1549
01:44:45,779 --> 01:44:48,055
...your sister-in-law will be mom soon.

1550
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:49,651
What? You too?

1551
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:53,493
You mean, last night...
- with Gracy.

1552
01:44:53,553 --> 01:44:56,591
Even I do the right
things in the dark.

1553
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:57,791
Cheers.

1554
01:44:58,058 --> 01:44:59,196
- Do you know how?
- How?

1555
01:44:59,559 --> 01:45:00,559
Like this!

1556
01:45:01,061 --> 01:45:02,061
Blindfold?

1557
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:04,730
Handcuff?

1558
01:45:07,034 --> 01:45:08,034
Whip?

1559
01:45:08,535 --> 01:45:10,446
But how do you know?

1560
01:45:11,605 --> 01:45:13,585
Because last night you three...

1561
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:16,621
...slept with these three.

1562
01:45:17,110 --> 01:45:18,350
After you got drunk.

1563
01:45:18,745 --> 01:45:22,056
And this calls for... Papa! Urja!

1564
01:45:22,115 --> 01:45:24,061
Ganga! Jamuna! Saraswati!

1565
01:45:24,484 --> 01:45:26,521
Papa... sir...

1566
01:45:26,586 --> 01:45:30,762
Last night your three
sons slept with the housemaids.

1567
01:45:33,327 --> 01:45:37,070
No, no, we... we... didn't want
to sleep with them.

1568
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:38,131
Right!

1569
01:45:38,198 --> 01:45:40,007
They wanted to sleep with us.

1570
01:45:40,067 --> 01:45:42,707
And that too before the wedding papa!

1571
01:45:45,539 --> 01:45:47,339
So these are the guys
you were advocating for.

1572
01:45:52,012 --> 01:45:54,652
Batook sir, now we want justice!

1573
01:45:54,715 --> 01:45:57,594
Compensation or rape charges!

1574
01:45:57,651 --> 01:45:58,721
Yes!

1575
01:46:01,655 --> 01:46:04,534
My advice is that you su-su on them.

1576
01:46:04,991 --> 01:46:07,267
I mean... sue them twice.

1577
01:46:07,327 --> 01:46:09,739
Once for rape,
and once for compensation.

1578
01:46:09,996 --> 01:46:10,996
Sue-sue!

1579
01:46:11,098 --> 01:46:14,545
Urja... take my advice... and
give them 5000... - Billion.

1580
01:46:14,601 --> 01:46:16,103
50 billion!

1581
01:46:16,169 --> 01:46:17,648
Have you lost it?

1582
01:46:17,738 --> 01:46:20,218
First ask for your 50 billion.
- Oh yes.

1583
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:22,613
First give me my 50 billion.

1584
01:46:22,676 --> 01:46:24,087
Let's sit down and make a deal.

1585
01:46:24,144 --> 01:46:24,986
No need to point...

1586
01:46:25,045 --> 01:46:26,490
'He's mute, how can he...'

1587
01:46:26,546 --> 01:46:27,546
I did.

1588
01:46:28,682 --> 01:46:29,682
Should I say it again?

1589
01:46:30,751 --> 01:46:34,096
Let's sit down and make a deal;
No need to point.

1590
01:46:34,154 --> 01:46:35,098
Mimicry artist.

1591
01:46:35,155 --> 01:46:36,293
'Oh, Sandy said it.'

1592
01:46:36,356 --> 01:46:37,528
'Hold on... Sandy's blind.'

1593
01:46:37,591 --> 01:46:38,711
'How did he see his finger?'

1594
01:46:38,759 --> 01:46:40,670
There were two of them.

1595
01:46:40,761 --> 01:46:41,705
One spoke and the other saw.

1596
01:46:41,762 --> 01:46:43,366
Come back to the 50 billion.

1597
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:44,704
How did the mute guy speak?

1598
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:47,612
I did. I did.

1599
01:46:48,168 --> 01:46:50,114
<i>I said come back to
the topic of 50 billion.</i>

1600
01:46:50,604 --> 01:46:52,709
It's really simple, Urja.
- Did you see?

1601
01:46:52,773 --> 01:46:54,343
I am blind.

1602
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:55,785
Do I have to explain?

1603
01:46:56,309 --> 01:46:58,016
Now listen carefully, Urja.

1604
01:46:58,278 --> 01:47:00,724
You have to take 50 billion from him.

1605
01:47:01,047 --> 01:47:01,616
Right?

1606
01:47:01,715 --> 01:47:05,026
And you've to compensate
50 billion to the girls...

1607
01:47:05,085 --> 01:47:07,531
...because of your sons
misadventures last night.

1608
01:47:07,587 --> 01:47:09,332
So papa will transfer
it in the maids' accounts.

1609
01:47:09,356 --> 01:47:10,433
So considered that settled.

1610
01:47:10,457 --> 01:47:11,561
He'll pay them.

1611
01:47:11,725 --> 01:47:12,999
End of the matter, right?

1612
01:47:13,059 --> 01:47:15,266
- Papa... sir...
- who said that?

1613
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:19,606
All we know is we don't
love your sons, we love them.

1614
01:47:22,202 --> 01:47:23,203
Enough!

1615
01:47:24,004 --> 01:47:26,041
Now there's going to be two weddings.

1616
01:47:26,106 --> 01:47:29,053
First, my sons will marry the maids.

1617
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:30,417
Yes!

1618
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:34,080
And Batook's daughters
will marry these poor chaps.

1619
01:47:35,615 --> 01:47:39,688
- Yes!
- Put me down, put me down!

1620
01:47:52,165 --> 01:47:55,635
Sarah, now tell us
why you brought us here?

1621
01:47:55,702 --> 01:47:58,273
I know, the girls
are getting desperate.

1622
01:47:58,338 --> 01:47:59,682
Even two days are too much for them.

1623
01:47:59,706 --> 01:48:01,379
They want to get married today, right?

1624
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:04,985
Guys... we're not getting married.

1625
01:48:05,545 --> 01:48:08,287
Today we want to confess
something in church.

1626
01:48:08,715 --> 01:48:10,524
I think you should come with us.

1627
01:48:14,421 --> 01:48:15,661
What confession?

1628
01:48:19,259 --> 01:48:21,569
I think it's an old affair.

1629
01:48:21,628 --> 01:48:23,039
What are you saying?

1630
01:48:23,096 --> 01:48:24,296
- 100 percent, come on.
- Come.

1631
01:48:50,190 --> 01:48:55,196
God... we're going to be starting
a new life from tomorrow.

1632
01:48:56,296 --> 01:48:57,775
We're going to be getting married.

1633
01:49:01,034 --> 01:49:05,107
But this morning... something happened...

1634
01:49:06,473 --> 01:49:11,047
Sarah's special kids,

1635
01:49:11,311 --> 01:49:16,727
her, Jenny, me.
All 3 of us really got disturbed.

1636
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:20,655
There's one boy, Simon.

1637
01:49:23,156 --> 01:49:24,965
He has a problem with his leg.

1638
01:49:27,527 --> 01:49:29,529
Some boys teased him.

1639
01:49:29,963 --> 01:49:32,409
They made fun of
him because of his leg.

1640
01:49:32,465 --> 01:49:33,569
<i>Made fun of him.</i>

1641
01:49:35,101 --> 01:49:38,014
The moment I asked them,
those boys started lying.

1642
01:49:38,071 --> 01:49:39,573
<i>That we didn't imitate him.</i>

1643
01:49:40,206 --> 01:49:43,653
I made them realize that
they were completely wrong.

1644
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:48,055
They were not only mocking
Simon for being handicapped...

1645
01:49:48,114 --> 01:49:49,684
...but also lying.

1646
01:49:51,117 --> 01:49:57,193
And then... when Sarah told us,
what happened with her...

1647
01:49:58,391 --> 01:50:04,774
...we three realized that we've
been doing the same thing with papa.

1648
01:50:05,332 --> 01:50:07,403
We've been pretending too.

1649
01:50:08,268 --> 01:50:10,578
We've been lying to papa as well.

1650
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:14,013
And that is why we're
all here to confess.

1651
01:50:15,175 --> 01:50:18,384
God, we really love each other...

1652
01:50:18,445 --> 01:50:22,120
...but we've committed a very big sin.

1653
01:50:23,316 --> 01:50:25,116
I don't know whether
You'll forgive us or not.

1654
01:50:25,151 --> 01:50:27,131
He will forgive you my children.

1655
01:50:28,154 --> 01:50:32,625
Because whatever you have done,
you've done it for one reason.

1656
01:50:33,159 --> 01:50:36,038
And that is love. Real love.

1657
01:50:38,398 --> 01:50:40,344
So He will forgive you.

1658
01:50:41,067 --> 01:50:44,514
It would've been wrong
if you had done these things...

1659
01:50:44,604 --> 01:50:46,083
...for greed.

1660
01:50:49,309 --> 01:50:50,447
For money.

1661
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:56,560
Or for other worldly desires.

1662
01:51:00,553 --> 01:51:03,591
But you did it for true love.

1663
01:51:05,025 --> 01:51:08,370
God will bless you my children.

1664
01:51:21,307 --> 01:51:28,691
"My mind's here,
but my heart's somewhere else."

1665
01:51:29,015 --> 01:51:34,015
"Everything is fair,
in love and war."

1666
01:51:41,594 --> 01:51:43,198
"Papa."

1667
01:51:45,165 --> 01:51:46,542
"Papa.".

1668
01:51:46,599 --> 01:51:50,513
"My emotions are shaken up."

1669
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:57,554
"Like a banana's been peeled."

1670
01:52:00,246 --> 01:52:03,659
"My emotions are shaken up."

1671
01:52:03,717 --> 01:52:07,290
"Like a banana's been peeled."

1672
01:52:07,353 --> 01:52:09,663
"Love has shaken up up."

1673
01:52:09,723 --> 01:52:11,532
"Papa.".

1674
01:52:11,758 --> 01:52:15,433
"It was so fake..."

1675
01:52:15,762 --> 01:52:18,743
"My love... my love."

1676
01:52:18,998 --> 01:52:22,639
"Now it seems divine."

1677
01:52:22,702 --> 01:52:25,706
"My love... my love."

1678
01:52:25,772 --> 01:52:29,276
"It was so fake..."

1679
01:52:29,342 --> 01:52:32,448
"My love... my love."

1680
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:36,085
"Now it seems divine."

1681
01:52:36,149 --> 01:52:39,722
"My love... my love."

1682
01:52:42,789 --> 01:52:44,291
Hey, pass the ball.

1683
01:52:46,559 --> 01:52:48,639
What's wrong with you'?
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

1684
01:52:48,695 --> 01:52:52,404
"Love is such a scoundrel."

1685
01:52:52,465 --> 01:52:55,412
"Makes you sweat."

1686
01:52:55,468 --> 01:52:58,608
"Makes your life difficult."

1687
01:52:58,671 --> 01:53:02,551
"Makes your life difficult."

1688
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:08,287
"From heaven I've been
pushed to hell." - Open. Open.

1689
01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:12,760
"From heaven I've
been pushed to hell."

1690
01:53:13,019 --> 01:53:14,760
"we played the game of love."

1691
01:53:15,021 --> 01:53:16,329
Open up, hurry up in there.

1692
01:53:16,389 --> 01:53:17,299
I can't control it.

1693
01:53:17,357 --> 01:53:18,734
"Papa.".

1694
01:53:19,292 --> 01:53:22,762
"It was so fake..."

1695
01:53:23,029 --> 01:53:26,272
"My love... my love."

1696
01:53:26,332 --> 01:53:29,643
"Now it seems divine."

1697
01:53:29,702 --> 01:53:32,649
"My love... my love."

1698
01:53:32,705 --> 01:53:34,150
"Papa.".

1699
01:53:34,541 --> 01:53:38,114
"It was so fake..."

1700
01:53:38,178 --> 01:53:41,489
"My love... my love."

1701
01:53:41,548 --> 01:53:45,428
"Now it seems divine."

1702
01:53:45,485 --> 01:53:47,158
"My love... my love."

1703
01:53:47,220 --> 01:53:48,392
"Papa.".

1704
01:53:52,358 --> 01:53:55,669
Let's go and tell
the girls the truth.

1705
01:53:56,629 --> 01:53:59,132
That till date
we did everything for money.

1706
01:54:00,733 --> 01:54:02,542
And that we actually love them.

1707
01:54:05,572 --> 01:54:06,572
Come on.

1708
01:54:07,407 --> 01:54:08,545
Jenny just messaged me.

1709
01:54:09,042 --> 01:54:10,362
She called us at the wax factory.

1710
01:54:10,476 --> 01:54:14,288
Jenny lovingly made some
wax statue for me.

1711
01:54:14,647 --> 01:54:16,127
And the three girls are coming there.

1712
01:54:16,416 --> 01:54:17,416
So let's go there.

1713
01:54:17,450 --> 01:54:18,360
We'll tell them everything clearly.

1714
01:54:18,418 --> 01:54:19,418
Come on.

1715
01:54:23,556 --> 01:54:26,059
Oh God, what a place.

1716
01:54:26,125 --> 01:54:27,126
Rock!

1717
01:54:27,193 --> 01:54:28,297
Jackie Chan.

1718
01:54:28,428 --> 01:54:31,534
- Your Ronaldo.
- Yeah.

1719
01:54:37,237 --> 01:54:38,237
Teddy.

1720
01:54:38,571 --> 01:54:40,346
Your statue looks so real.

1721
01:54:44,477 --> 01:54:45,917
Who's that with his legs in the air?

1722
01:54:46,012 --> 01:54:47,320
That's Tiger Shroff.

1723
01:54:48,715 --> 01:54:50,319
What nonsense do you keep saying?

1724
01:55:04,330 --> 01:55:06,537
Must admit you three
played really well...

1725
01:55:06,733 --> 01:55:10,408
By pretending to be blind,
mute and crippled.

1726
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:12,980
Rajeev, the real fun begins now...

1727
01:55:13,539 --> 01:55:17,487
...when we beat these
normal guys to death.

1728
01:55:18,044 --> 01:55:19,284
<i>Hey...</i>

1729
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:22,250
He can single-handedly
deal with all of you.

1730
01:55:23,049 --> 01:55:26,087
Ladies and Gentlemen, to my right...

1731
01:55:26,152 --> 01:55:28,325
...weighing 188 pounds.

1732
01:55:28,388 --> 01:55:31,733
And to my left, standing <i>6</i> feet tall.

1733
01:55:31,991 --> 01:55:35,268
The brawler,
the kicker... the footballer...

1734
01:55:35,328 --> 01:55:38,400
<i>The junkyard's junk.</i>

1735
01:55:39,999 --> 01:55:43,139
I mean the player of all players.

1736
01:55:43,202 --> 01:55:44,010
Sorry...

1737
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,448
And he's going to...

1738
01:55:46,506 --> 01:55:47,644
One... two...

1739
01:55:48,207 --> 01:55:51,780
"Your mother-sister...
Mother-sister... Mother-sister..."

1740
01:55:53,212 --> 01:55:56,785
All you guys will get beat up.
Sandy will slap you all so hard.

1741
01:55:57,050 --> 01:55:58,727
With backward legs,
you all will reach Khandala's hills.

1742
01:55:58,751 --> 01:56:01,231
"Your mother-sister...
Mother-sister... Mother-sister..."

1743
01:56:11,631 --> 01:56:12,405
Let's sit.

1744
01:56:12,465 --> 01:56:13,967
Do you have some snacks?

1745
01:56:16,703 --> 01:56:17,703
Popcorn.

1746
01:56:23,743 --> 01:56:25,984
What's wrong with this Indian?

1747
01:56:26,045 --> 01:56:27,353
...Indian!"

1748
01:56:29,649 --> 01:56:31,094
No!

1749
01:56:31,451 --> 01:56:34,261
No, no, no, he said Indica.
- He said Indiana Jones.

1750
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,322
He said Indonesia.
- He said Indigo.

1751
01:56:36,389 --> 01:56:39,063
Guys... guys... I am okay.

1752
01:56:40,026 --> 01:56:42,131
Thank God,
but he didn't say Indian.

1753
01:56:44,364 --> 01:56:45,468
You dog!

1754
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:49,773
Now you two will get beaten up.

1755
01:56:50,436 --> 01:56:52,473
No, I won't let my friends die.

1756
01:56:52,538 --> 01:56:53,642
Sandy...

1757
01:56:54,007 --> 01:56:56,180
I am gonna let you two die.

1758
01:57:00,113 --> 01:57:01,114
Save us.

1759
01:57:03,416 --> 01:57:04,416
Save us.

1760
01:57:07,186 --> 01:57:08,460
<i>He's hurting himself.</i>

1761
01:57:12,425 --> 01:57:13,425
Keep saying Indian..

1762
01:57:13,526 --> 01:57:14,334
Save me.

1763
01:57:14,527 --> 01:57:15,733
Sundi, stop.

1764
01:57:16,329 --> 01:57:17,609
Sundi is going to knock you out.

1765
01:57:18,998 --> 01:57:20,443
Sundi will ring your bell.

1766
01:57:22,168 --> 01:57:23,374
Save me.

1767
01:57:31,544 --> 01:57:33,455
No Sundi, for my sake.

1768
01:57:53,466 --> 01:57:54,467
You dog.

1769
01:57:54,534 --> 01:57:55,774
"Let me go home...

1770
01:57:56,536 --> 01:57:57,446
"Let me go home...

1771
01:57:57,503 --> 01:57:58,503
One minute.

1772
01:57:58,571 --> 01:58:00,312
"Let me go home...

1773
01:58:00,373 --> 01:58:02,478
"Let me go home...
- what are you doing?

1774
01:58:02,708 --> 01:58:04,381
"Let me go home...

1775
01:58:04,944 --> 01:58:06,321
"Let me go home...

1776
01:58:17,590 --> 01:58:19,126
Now you're dead, Sandy.

1777
01:58:29,602 --> 01:58:30,602
Michael.

1778
01:58:31,304 --> 01:58:37,311
I am saved. I am saved. I saved.

1779
01:58:49,422 --> 01:58:56,340
No! - "I beloved,
can't live without you."

1780
01:59:02,368 --> 01:59:03,472
Are you okay?

1781
01:59:05,304 --> 01:59:09,684
Come. - "I beloved,
can'! Live without you."

1782
01:59:10,977 --> 01:59:13,116
Now this has become personal.

1783
01:59:28,094 --> 01:59:30,233
What's this message?

1784
01:59:33,166 --> 01:59:34,702
Those three are normal?

1785
01:59:42,608 --> 01:59:44,178
Are you mad?

1786
01:59:48,314 --> 01:59:49,315
Who is it?

1787
02:00:12,505 --> 02:00:15,418
Boys... boys... it's me, your daddy.

1788
02:00:15,474 --> 02:00:16,418
Let's get out of here...

1789
02:00:16,475 --> 02:00:20,446
...and go tell Urja Nagre that
these three are not handicapped.

1790
02:00:23,182 --> 02:00:28,256
Wow... wax statues of
you dues as well. Superb.

1791
02:00:31,657 --> 02:00:35,332
You made Urja Nagre
your sons' dad only for wealth.

1792
02:00:35,595 --> 02:00:38,337
Now we'll go tell Urja.

1793
02:00:38,397 --> 02:00:41,435
And Urja Nagre will
come here and take your pee!

1794
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:43,377
I mean... he will settle his score.

1795
02:00:43,436 --> 02:00:47,282
Hold on... if you squeal on us,
we're dead.

1796
02:00:47,340 --> 02:00:49,752
But if we expose you,
you three are dead too.

1797
02:00:49,809 --> 02:00:53,484
So the deal is... you guys
can marry Urja Nagre's daughters...

1798
02:00:53,546 --> 02:00:57,289
...but we want equal
shares in his wealth.

1799
02:00:58,317 --> 02:01:02,163
Batook Patel,
I want every penny accounted for.

1800
02:01:02,388 --> 02:01:03,526
Here's the calculator.

1801
02:01:03,589 --> 02:01:06,001
So... the wealth's worth 50 billion.

1802
02:01:06,058 --> 02:01:07,731
Divided into 7 skates.

1803
02:01:08,594 --> 02:01:09,766
That comes to...

1804
02:01:10,029 --> 02:01:12,031
Around 7 billion each.

1805
02:01:12,098 --> 02:01:13,543
- Divide by 8.
- Why 8?

1806
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:15,078
- There's two of me.
- Huh!

1807
02:01:15,134 --> 02:01:16,204
Sundi and Sandy.

1808
02:01:16,269 --> 02:01:19,546
What nonsense...
- Should I call Urja?

1809
02:01:20,673 --> 02:01:22,380
Divide by 8.

1810
02:01:22,441 --> 02:01:23,442
So that's...

1811
02:01:23,509 --> 02:01:25,716
50 divide by 8...

1812
02:01:25,778 --> 02:01:28,122
6 billion per head.

1813
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:29,591
One minute.

1814
02:01:32,151 --> 02:01:35,496
I'm a chef for the world,
but actually...

1815
02:01:35,554 --> 02:01:39,525
...I am an undercover FBI agent.

1816
02:01:43,162 --> 02:01:45,608
I'm joking!

1817
02:01:45,665 --> 02:01:47,167
"Pasta."

1818
02:01:47,233 --> 02:01:49,179
I received a message
that you're all here.

1819
02:01:49,235 --> 02:01:52,239
Now I want equal share in the money.

1820
02:01:52,471 --> 02:01:54,542
50 billion divide by 9.

1821
02:01:54,607 --> 02:01:55,176
That means...

1822
02:01:55,241 --> 02:01:57,152
5 billion each.

1823
02:01:57,543 --> 02:01:59,580
Hey, one minute.

1824
02:02:04,750 --> 02:02:06,491
10, 11, 12...

1825
02:02:06,552 --> 02:02:08,054
Divide by 12.

1826
02:02:08,287 --> 02:02:10,096
4 billion each.

1827
02:02:10,156 --> 02:02:14,104
Hey... don't divide by 12,
divide by 15.

1828
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:14,763
Why?

1829
02:02:15,027 --> 02:02:18,133
We have your sons" babies in our womb.

1830
02:02:18,197 --> 02:02:19,039
Yeah.

1831
02:02:19,098 --> 02:02:20,441
Womb?

1832
02:02:22,201 --> 02:02:22,736
Idiot.

1833
02:02:23,002 --> 02:02:26,176
- Rascals, you learned to ride a bike,
but not to wear a helmet.

1834
02:02:26,238 --> 02:02:28,149
Batook, congratulations.

1835
02:02:28,207 --> 02:02:29,327
You've become a grandfather.

1836
02:02:31,544 --> 02:02:33,182
Whatever! 13, 14, 15.

1837
02:02:33,446 --> 02:02:36,359
3 billion each!

1838
02:02:36,415 --> 02:02:39,089
Great.

1839
02:02:39,151 --> 02:02:42,132
I worked so hand for 15 years,
only to get 3 billion...

1840
02:02:42,188 --> 02:02:43,792
Sorry, Mr. Rajnikant.

1841
02:02:44,056 --> 02:02:46,730
Did you hear?
Do you want a share too?

1842
02:02:46,792 --> 02:02:47,792
Speak up.

1843
02:02:48,561 --> 02:02:52,338
Oh... Mr. Obama. You heard it too.

1844
02:02:52,398 --> 02:02:54,207
Do you want a share as well?

1845
02:02:55,167 --> 02:02:57,147
And what are you looking at?

1846
02:02:57,203 --> 02:02:58,477
You got your share!

1847
02:03:00,339 --> 02:03:04,185
Urja. Your statue.

1848
02:03:04,577 --> 02:03:05,419
What are you looking at?

1849
02:03:05,478 --> 02:03:07,185
We're splitting you money only.

1850
02:03:07,246 --> 02:03:10,716
You always keep saying BJK... ATM... etc...

1851
02:03:18,691 --> 02:03:24,767
I saw Saraswati's picture
on Bunty's laptop.

1852
02:03:25,464 --> 02:03:26,738
And while watching it...

1853
02:03:26,999 --> 02:03:29,036
"Listen what say Mr. Bachchan."

1854
02:03:29,101 --> 02:03:30,739
"speak... speak... speak."

1855
02:03:33,506 --> 02:03:37,318
I called Batook to tell
the truth about you three.

1856
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:41,553
It was out of reach,
so I called on the office landline.

1857
02:03:41,614 --> 02:03:43,218
'But your orphan plan was a flop.'

1858
02:03:43,282 --> 02:03:44,590
'I am your father, get it.'

1859
02:03:44,650 --> 02:03:49,565
'I got Urja Nagre arrested. You guys
have no idea what all I have done.'

1860
02:03:55,795 --> 02:03:58,469
Every dog is loyal.

1861
02:03:59,331 --> 02:04:02,574
But my own trustworthy
chap turned out to be a dog.

1862
02:04:02,668 --> 02:04:05,672
I messaged all of
you using a software.

1863
02:04:05,738 --> 02:04:07,308
Because I want to give.

1864
02:04:08,107 --> 02:04:10,178
SMS.

1865
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:13,454
Death Sentence to everyone.

1866
02:04:13,512 --> 02:04:14,388
Mamma-Mia.

1867
02:04:14,447 --> 02:04:17,621
Who wants to die first?
- Me! I want to die first.

1868
02:04:18,050 --> 02:04:19,050
I am leaving.

1869
02:04:19,418 --> 02:04:22,627
Urja, don't shoot me to pieces.

1870
02:04:22,721 --> 02:04:23,563
Kill them.

1871
02:04:23,622 --> 02:04:25,363
- No, no... him.
- Beat them.

1872
02:04:25,424 --> 02:04:28,371
No! Shoot them!
- Shoot these buggers.

1873
02:04:29,195 --> 02:04:30,196
No!

1874
02:04:33,199 --> 02:04:34,507
Urja...

1875
02:04:34,567 --> 02:04:38,413
My first name means last so,
I'll be at the end of the line.

1876
02:04:38,471 --> 02:04:41,645
It was the question of all babies,
forgive us.

1877
02:04:41,740 --> 02:04:46,485
Urja Nagre, if you kill us...
- Then our father will be an orphan!

1878
02:04:47,012 --> 02:04:48,423
Kill our dad.

1879
02:04:48,481 --> 02:04:51,291
Urja Nagre... the door of
your heart should always be big...

1880
02:04:51,350 --> 02:04:53,296
...because even computers have windows.

1881
02:04:55,321 --> 02:04:56,595
Delhi Agra...

1882
02:04:56,655 --> 02:04:57,497
Skirt blouse...

1883
02:04:57,556 --> 02:04:58,591
<i>Dhokla Khakra.</i>

1884
02:04:58,657 --> 02:04:59,658
<i>Hunku Pakhre.</i>

1885
02:04:59,758 --> 02:05:01,362
It's Urja Nagre!

1886
02:05:01,427 --> 02:05:03,031
Then you only talk.

1887
02:05:03,162 --> 02:05:04,470
You see, sir...

1888
02:05:04,530 --> 02:05:06,441
...wherever I stand,
the line ends there only.

1889
02:05:06,499 --> 02:05:07,000
Hey!

1890
02:05:07,066 --> 02:05:08,066
Okay bye!

1891
02:05:08,167 --> 02:05:09,669
Nagre sir, don't shoot me.

1892
02:05:09,735 --> 02:05:11,715
If you shoot me,
you'll be sentenced to life.

1893
02:05:11,971 --> 02:05:13,541
And you'll also be hanged.

1894
02:05:13,606 --> 02:05:15,381
Because there's two of me. Two.

1895
02:05:15,441 --> 02:05:17,011
- Sandy, Sundi... two.
- Shut up!

1896
02:05:18,310 --> 02:05:21,450
Now all of you will DIE.

1897
02:05:22,615 --> 02:05:24,094
Full form.

1898
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:28,757
No full form. All will die.

1899
02:05:49,475 --> 02:05:51,614
"Pasta."

1900
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:22,576
where is everyone hiding?

1901
02:06:31,517 --> 02:06:32,996
This way... this way.

1902
02:06:38,557 --> 02:06:40,537
Lookalike! Lookalike! Lookalike!

1903
02:06:40,593 --> 02:06:42,095
No!

1904
02:06:43,462 --> 02:06:45,339
Where's Urja?

1905
02:06:45,397 --> 02:06:47,377
- Urja!
- Why you!

1906
02:07:12,091 --> 02:07:13,297
Ronaldo's clothes?

1907
02:07:16,295 --> 02:07:17,330
<i>Mummy!</i>

1908
02:07:18,163 --> 02:07:19,039
What are you doing?

1909
02:07:19,098 --> 02:07:20,098
It's me your brother.

1910
02:07:21,133 --> 02:07:22,578
Look, look, look.

1911
02:07:27,439 --> 02:07:29,476
Look, look... wire, wire.

1912
02:07:35,414 --> 02:07:36,586
Urja.

1913
02:07:40,619 --> 02:07:41,256
Hey! Hey!

1914
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:42,060
Sandy!

1915
02:07:42,121 --> 02:07:43,191
Slow. .Slow.

1916
02:07:43,255 --> 02:07:44,325
What happened?

1917
02:07:44,390 --> 02:07:46,233
We didn't get the
wealth because of you.

1918
02:07:46,291 --> 02:07:49,568
And... now you won't get
the girls love because of us.

1919
02:07:49,628 --> 02:07:50,766
Got it.

1920
02:07:57,002 --> 02:07:58,379
You dog!

1921
02:07:58,437 --> 02:08:00,644
Shoved it in, but don't twist it.

1922
02:08:00,706 --> 02:08:02,652
- Don't twist it!
- Sandy.

1923
02:08:15,688 --> 02:08:18,726
What did you guys do?
- why did you guys do this for us?

1924
02:08:18,991 --> 02:08:20,368
Sandy.

1925
02:08:20,426 --> 02:08:26,604
That day in the church...
you three confessed in front of God.

1926
02:08:27,399 --> 02:08:31,074
Today we want to confess too.
- what?

1927
02:08:31,136 --> 02:08:35,585
Actually, all three of
us suffer from split personalities.

1928
02:08:36,008 --> 02:08:39,319
First it was for money,
but now it's for love.

1929
02:08:39,378 --> 02:08:40,378
Correct.

1930
02:08:44,983 --> 02:08:47,259
- Teddy.
- Yes.

1931
02:08:47,753 --> 02:08:49,460
<i>Oh, Bunty.</i>

1932
02:08:50,055 --> 02:08:51,466
- I love you.
- What?

1933
02:08:51,523 --> 02:08:53,068
I mean sister-in-law... sister-in-law...

1934
02:08:53,092 --> 02:08:53,695
Slow...

1935
02:08:53,759 --> 02:08:54,294
Sister-in-law.

1936
02:08:54,359 --> 02:08:56,396
Everyone go to their girl.

1937
02:08:56,729 --> 02:09:00,040
Saraswati.
Saraswati. Saraswati. Saraswati.

1938
02:09:00,099 --> 02:09:01,099
I love you, my darling.

1939
02:09:01,133 --> 02:09:02,043
I love you.

1940
02:09:02,101 --> 02:09:03,512
- I love you.
- I love you.

1941
02:09:06,705 --> 02:09:11,279
And listen, forgive this man too.

1942
02:09:11,944 --> 02:09:17,417
Because Batook isn't your father,
Urja Nagre is.

1943
02:09:17,483 --> 02:09:18,120
Yes.

1944
02:09:18,183 --> 02:09:19,594
- What?
- Yes.

1945
02:09:19,685 --> 02:09:21,062
He's your father.

1946
02:09:44,109 --> 02:09:45,144
Go.

1947
02:09:45,544 --> 02:09:47,751
- Papa.
- Papa.

1948
02:09:51,083 --> 02:09:52,289
Don't worry, daddy.

1949
02:09:52,417 --> 02:09:54,693
You served time for your crimes right?

1950
02:09:54,753 --> 02:09:56,323
Yes.

1951
02:09:56,388 --> 02:09:59,631
Papa... whatever
you were for the world...

1952
02:10:00,192 --> 02:10:02,103
...but for us,
you will always be our father.

1953
02:10:02,161 --> 02:10:02,696
Yes.

1954
02:10:02,761 --> 02:10:04,263
And we're all proud of you.

1955
02:10:04,329 --> 02:10:05,603
We're so proud of you, daddy.

1956
02:10:05,697 --> 02:10:08,701
Me too. Love you my babies.
- we're finally together.

1957
02:10:08,767 --> 02:10:10,178
Hey... <i>- Sorry..</i>

1958
02:10:10,235 --> 02:10:11,111
Don't do it.

1959
02:10:11,170 --> 02:10:12,240
Sandy.

1960
02:10:12,304 --> 02:10:15,513
- Bunty.
- Give me the gun.

1961
02:10:17,776 --> 02:10:19,778
All done... finally done.

1962
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:24,318
All's well that ends well.
- Yes.

1963
02:10:25,384 --> 02:10:28,422
And papa,
we want to have an Indian wedding.

1964
02:10:28,620 --> 02:10:29,724
"Indian."

1965
02:10:37,296 --> 02:10:38,297
"Bloody love..."

1966
02:10:38,363 --> 02:10:40,809
"Bloody love... From today
love will be like a prayer."

1967
02:10:41,066 --> 02:10:43,546
"Bloody love..."

1968
02:10:43,602 --> 02:10:44,672
That's enough.

1969
02:10:44,736 --> 02:10:45,612
"Bloody love..."

1970
02:10:45,671 --> 02:10:47,831
"Bloody love... From today
love will be like a prayer."

1971
02:10:48,073 --> 02:10:49,518
Bunty, stop leaning on me.

1972
02:10:52,110 --> 02:10:56,058
Wo... shoot, murder...

1973
02:10:57,449 --> 02:10:59,053
I forgot.

1974
02:11:03,155 --> 02:11:04,293
Where are you going?

1975
02:11:04,356 --> 02:11:06,632
- Help me, help me.
- Wait, wait.

1976
02:11:08,994 --> 02:11:14,501
A goon came with a knife... shh... shh...

1977
02:11:17,736 --> 02:11:18,578
I did...

1978
02:11:18,637 --> 02:11:20,048
"You look so sexy."

1979
02:11:20,105 --> 02:11:21,106
"Your gorgeous body..."

1980
02:11:21,173 --> 02:11:23,380
"Your gorgeous body, blows my mind."

1981
02:11:24,042 --> 02:11:25,680
"Your hot figure, blows my mind."

1982
02:11:25,744 --> 02:11:28,384
<i>" Anyone you trap,
only God can save him."</i>

1983
02:11:28,447 --> 02:11:31,428
"I've never seen anyone
like you." - Let go of the button.

1984
02:11:33,418 --> 02:11:36,729
"Expensive liners,
and those dangly earrings."

1985
02:11:36,788 --> 02:11:38,631
"The glittering skirt..."

1986
02:11:38,690 --> 02:11:40,535
"...and the way you sway
that waist is priceless."

1987
02:11:40,559 --> 02:11:44,268
Hey! I'm dead. - "Expensive liners,
and those dangly earrings."

1988
02:11:44,329 --> 02:11:46,070
"The glittering skirt..."

1989
02:11:46,131 --> 02:11:47,375
"...and the way you sway
that waist is priceless."

1990
02:11:47,399 --> 02:11:48,503
That day I...

1991
02:11:49,201 --> 02:11:50,509
- Sir... sir...
- what?

1992
02:11:50,569 --> 02:11:51,741
Wait... it's my dialogue.

1993
02:11:52,337 --> 02:11:54,180
Sir, the camera isn't rolling.

1994
02:11:54,239 --> 02:11:54,808
And yes...

1995
02:11:55,073 --> 02:11:57,212
The cameraman went on a lunch-break.

1996
02:11:57,276 --> 02:12:00,553
"You're the richest girl
in the world, sweetheart."

1997
02:12:00,612 --> 02:12:01,612
Come on, son.

1998
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:03,682
This looks bad at this age.

1999
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:06,256
You want to marry Batook?

2000
02:12:06,318 --> 02:12:07,194
Crap!

2001
02:12:07,252 --> 02:12:08,094
Where did you go?

2002
02:12:08,153 --> 02:12:09,325
Slap me again quickly.

2003
02:12:09,688 --> 02:12:10,257
You...

2004
02:12:10,322 --> 02:12:11,357
You always leave before.

2005
02:12:11,423 --> 02:12:12,543
Okay, sorry it's my mistake.

2006
02:12:12,591 --> 02:12:14,468
Why you... perfect.

2007
02:12:16,762 --> 02:12:18,298
My pants are very tight.

2008
02:12:26,672 --> 02:12:29,209
Akshay, get out soon...
or I won't give you your cheque.

2009
02:12:31,143 --> 02:12:32,781
'Rock-a-by baby...'

2010
02:12:33,278 --> 02:12:34,278
Milk...

2011
02:12:34,313 --> 02:12:36,725
'Rock-a-by baby...'

2012
02:12:37,516 --> 02:12:39,189
Milk bowls.

2013
02:12:40,752 --> 02:12:42,129
Who am I now?

2014
02:12:42,187 --> 02:12:42,722
Sandy.

2015
02:12:42,788 --> 02:12:43,425
I forgot.

2016
02:12:43,488 --> 02:12:44,592
Who am I now?

2017
02:12:44,656 --> 02:12:45,566
"Bloody love..."

2018
02:12:45,624 --> 02:12:48,070
"Bloody love... From today
love will be like a prayer."

2019
02:12:48,126 --> 02:12:50,697
"You're the richest, darling."

2020
02:12:50,762 --> 02:12:52,400
"Housefull three."

2021
02:12:52,464 --> 02:12:56,139
<i>"If you become my dear, like
a small baby I'll take care of you."</i>

2022
02:12:56,201 --> 02:13:00,047
"when we're in love, then
why did your father call the priest?"

2023
02:13:00,072 --> 02:13:01,716
"I've just one thing to say to you,
I sweat..."

2024
02:13:01,740 --> 02:13:03,583
"...you're stuck to
me like chewing gum."

2025
02:13:03,642 --> 02:13:05,349
"Oh baby, have mercy on our love."

2026
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:07,321
"You're my bread, and I am you jam."

2027
02:13:07,379 --> 02:13:10,690
"Life is short,
let's say those sweet-nothings."

2028
02:13:10,749 --> 02:13:14,629
"If you say it once,
I'll do anything for you."

2029
02:13:14,686 --> 02:13:16,397
"This is your chance,
and also the ritual..."

2030
02:13:16,421 --> 02:13:18,401
"...but why you standing far."

2031
02:13:18,457 --> 02:13:21,666
"Take me in your arms,
like a true prince."

2032
02:13:21,727 --> 02:13:23,673
"The moons showing attitude."

2033
02:13:23,729 --> 02:13:25,675
"Even the sun's talking gibberish."

2034
02:13:25,731 --> 02:13:30,510
"In this awesome weather
give me a English kiss."

2035
02:13:30,569 --> 02:13:34,449
"You're the richest girl in the world,
sweetheart."

2036
02:13:34,506 --> 02:13:38,147
"You're the richest girl in the world,
sweetheart."

2037
02:13:38,210 --> 02:13:39,245
"Bloody love..."

2038
02:13:39,311 --> 02:13:41,791
"Bloody love... From today
love will be like a prayer."

2039
02:13:43,615 --> 02:13:46,152
"You're the richest, darling."

2040
02:13:46,218 --> 02:13:47,788
"Housefull three."

2041
02:13:54,726 --> 02:13:56,569
"Bloody love..."

2042
02:13:56,628 --> 02:13:58,539
"You're the richest girl in the world,
sweetheart."

2043
02:13:58,563 --> 02:14:00,372
"Bloody love..."
