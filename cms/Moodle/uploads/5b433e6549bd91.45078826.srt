1
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,973
"The looks and complexion. The gait and attitude."

2
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:05,616
"She is a real beauty.
Everyone's spellbound."

3
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:15,286
"The looks and complexion.
The gait and attitude."

4
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:19,659
"She is a real beauty.
Everyone's spellbound."

5
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,205
"I added the zest to life."

6
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:32,841
"I added the glow to light."

7
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:37,347
"it's a new ambiance,
new breeze blowing."

8
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:42,418
"I am new and so is my attitude."

9
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:47,622
"Your tresses, your piercing eyes."

10
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:52,396
"They are so amazing.
Everyone's spellbound."

11
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:57,032
"Your tresses, your piercing eyes."

12
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,634
"They are so amazing.
Everyone's spellbound."

13
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:24,862
"I wish to wear the
stars around my neck."

14
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,927
"And the moon on my forehead."

15
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:34,198
"I wish to dwell the
entire ocean in my eyes."

16
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,574
"Wonder why the heart desires that."

17
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,706
"Some think I am crazy."

18
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:47,006
"I don't care."

19
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:52,187
"All I know."

20
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,693
"The heart searches for a way."

21
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:01,765
"The heart searches for a way."

22
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,668
"You gave color to life."

23
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,030
"You gave energy to life."

24
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,499
"You gave enthusiasm."

25
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,040
"Everyone's spellbound."

26
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:15,169
"I added the zest to life."

27
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:19,878
"I added the glow to light."

28
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:24,416
"it's a new ambiance,
new breeze blowing."

29
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,284
"I am new and so is my attitude."

30
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,779
Come on, come on.. let's go.

31
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,385
Didi, where are we going next?

32
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,337
Francis?

33
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,505
What's the consignment like?

34
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,769
40 kilos.

35
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,236
Let me have it.

36
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,350
Don't you want to know the rate?

37
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,108
We are not here to buy from you.

38
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,087
Then'?
- We'll take it.

39
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,089
Look at my size
before you say something.

40
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,159
You aren't snatching
ice cream from a kid.

41
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,762
You are stealing a
consignment from Francis

42
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,107
You aren't laughing any more.

43
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,043
No.

44
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,909
Right now I'm angry.

45
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:30,966
My God.

46
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,121
Sorry, Francis.

47
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,029
I know I can't afford it but..

48
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,759
I can help you sell it.

49
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,366
If you ever try to
double-cross me again, you'll get it.

50
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:00,662
The bullets will do the talking.

51
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,273
Give me two day's time..
your work will be done.

52
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,240
Hello.

53
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,436
Vijay Bhai, this is Francis.

54
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,072
We had asked for bread..
where is it ?

55
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,941
How big is the consignment?

56
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,042
40 kilos.
- What?

57
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,554
40 kilos?

58
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,989
Only More can buy such a big load.

59
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,394
I can take you to one of his men.

60
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,793
Anything you want you are
sure to get it at Modern mall.

61
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,162
You are sure to find More there.

62
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,173
Excuse me.

63
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,064
Oh. This isn't yours?

64
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,263
Even you know that.

65
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,820
40 kilos?

66
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,579
What's the rate? - If you
can take all of it, I'll give..

67
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,919
..You a 10% discount.

68
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,620
Where is the stuff from?
- Punjab border.

69
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,797
The deal can be worked out but
More has a trusted supplier.

70
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,868
Cheema . But he won't..
- Where can I find Cheema?

71
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,271
Cheema is a total wacko.

72
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:57,043
Anybody taller than 5 feet
5 inches is a cop to him.

73
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,940
He is always armed.

74
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,144
And he doesn't think twice
before shooting in a public place.

75
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,353
Do you live around here..'?

76
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,758
What's your name?

77
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:47,357
I'm not talking to you nor
do I need to tell you my name.

78
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:22,163
Cheema.
- Sorry?

79
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,063
Sir! I stay in this area.

80
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,700
You can call my house
and check if you'd like.

81
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:30,399
My no is
- 267103415

82
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,032
I am not interested
in your phone number.

83
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,408
You moved the barricade
and that's not allowed.

84
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,947
Sir! I accept that I made a mistake.

85
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,812
I shouldn't have
moved the barricade.

86
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,077
Sir! I won't do it again.

87
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,708
You are acting smart
in front of the girl?

88
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,787
No Sir !
- He is not acting smart.

89
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,447
We just need to reach home soon.

90
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,988
Sorry, it was a mistake.

91
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,719
Please let me go.
- How can I let you go?

92
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,523
Sir, I'll drop my friend and return.

93
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,257
I'll be back in 30 minutes.

94
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,500
So until then I should
conduct an orchestra?

95
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,297
But, sir..
- You can go after you pay the fine.

96
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,837
Didn't you see the license?

97
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,929
The insurance papers
are with his friend.

98
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,270
Are the papers too
heavy to keep with you?

99
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,139
Law and order aren't mere words.

100
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,983
Sir!
- What's the problem?

101
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,350
Sir, they removed the
barricade and tried to get away.

102
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,984
What's your name?
- Raja, sir.

103
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,452
Sir, we've met before.

104
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,494
ACP Yashvardhan was
with the crime branch.

105
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,153
I work with Aastha.

106
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,265
I met you for the
de-addiction program last year.

107
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,334
Last year in Jogeshwari.
Don't you remember?

108
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,303
What's your name?

109
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,270
Maya.

110
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,903
Address?

111
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:46,481
B-501, Sai Sadan, Sai
Baba Colony Goregoan East.

112
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,313
Last time around you
refused to tell me.

113
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,921
Sir ! They don't have
relevant documents for his vehicle.

114
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,582
Where are you coming from?

115
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,430
We're returning after
watching a late night show.

116
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,265
Is she your sister?
- No, sir, she's a friend.

117
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,495
What do you mean 'friend"?
- 'Friend' means a friend.

118
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,861
Friend?

119
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,069
It's late at night,
you are out with a girl..

120
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,937
You are roaming without papers..

121
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,545
You remove a police
barricade knowing ..

122
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,907
"That it's kept
there for a purpose.

123
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,811
What kind of a
friend does that make you?

124
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,974
A stupid one, I think.

125
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,242
I am sorry, sir.

126
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,254
It's okay.

127
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,052
Let them go.
- Yes sir.

128
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,785
Thank you sir.
- Go on.

129
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,287
You should always keep
your vehicle documents ..

130
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,487
..With you, when
you are on the road.

131
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,858
Sir! This is the first
time that I don't have ..

132
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,226
..Necessary documents with me.

133
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,458
So isn't that your fault?

134
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,262
You're afraid of guys
with stubble and tattoos..

135
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:39,994
Sir?

136
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,733
And you move police
barricades with clean shaven guys!

137
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,701
Interesting.

138
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,847
More!

139
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,184
If I hadn't caught you today..

140
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,951
..L certainly would've
become a drug peddler.

141
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,334
Sir..

142
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,574
Yash..

143
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,739
What's up?

144
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,316
Did More give any more names?

145
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:04,182
No, sir.
- Then what was so urgent?

146
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,184
We could've spoken tomorrow.
- We have a new informer.

147
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,636
Information about?

148
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,801
I will give you
information about everything.

149
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,773
Let me begin with Acetic Anhydrite.

150
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,810
Then I shall go to LSD,
Heroin, Mandrax..

151
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,943
And Ketamine.

152
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,412
And quantity?

153
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,421
Ounces, grams, kilos..

154
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,021
You can forget about them.

155
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:46,252
Get this, all shipments will
stop coming into Mumbai and..

156
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,888
No shipments will go out.

157
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,361
The only way to prevent a leak
is a small and efficient unit.

158
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,301
Apart from your team and mine,
we won't share..

159
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,135
.. This information with others.

160
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,469
Whom do you have in mind?
- Atul Kalsekar.

161
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,674
He knows the NDPS act by heart.

162
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,507
The lawsuits
prepared by him will help..

163
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,276
Us get convictions
in the NDPS court.

164
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,910
Who else?
- There's a new recruit.

165
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,984
Mahesh Pande. What do you think?

166
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,283
Mahesh.. you look like a salesman.

167
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,159
What's wrong with t-shirt and leans?

168
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,767
Rachna, it's the NCB,
not your call center.

169
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,833
He will be a big plus.
- I have another suggestion.

170
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,038
He's unconventional
but his on-street ..

171
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:33,473
..Network and
intelligence are excellent.

172
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,344
Kamlesh Sawant?

173
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,278
Glad I caught you
without your clothes on.

174
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,611
Makes it so easy to check.

175
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,919
So, everyone ready for
blood and urine test?

176
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,752
Boys.. - Yash is in
charge of the operation.

177
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,126
All of you will
report directly to Yash.

178
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,263
I will tell you about four gangs.

179
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,096
We will handle four major groups.

180
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,170
And the business is
divided amongst these gangs.

181
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,636
The first racket
is Acetic Anhydrite.

182
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,536
The NCB maintains a
watch on the factory..

183
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,643
.. That manufactures this chemical.

184
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,371
No chemical factory
gives it diversion.

185
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:12,176
The gang has an arrangement
with the company truck drivers.

186
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,082
They steal small
quantities and when ..

187
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,777
..Enough use it
for big consignments.

188
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,855
The gang's base is in Kutch.

189
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,355
The gang's real kingpin is Kunwar.

190
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,864
Dharmesh is the handler.

191
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,826
Acetic Anhydrite isn't a drug.
It's a precursor chemical.

192
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:35,097
It's used to prepare Mandrax
and separate Heroin from Opium.

193
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,942
Dharmesh.

194
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:50,376
I neither want you
nor your 15 liters!

195
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,553
I want Kunwar.

196
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,118
Who is Kunwar, sir?

197
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,023
Sham e that's a wrong answer.

198
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:05,499
Sir, 18 kilometers from here is a
village on the border called Bani.

199
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:09,095
Kunwar conducts all his
business activities from there.

200
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,279
LSD.

201
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,548
The biggest factory is in Goa.

202
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,126
Manufacturers, suppliers,
peddlers.. are all foreigners.

203
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:38,028
A Ukrainian gang has a
stranglehold on the entire business.

204
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,033
They don't trust others.

205
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,999
Their leader is Bruno.

206
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:20,639
Majority of the Heroin in
Mumbai comes from the Punjab border.

207
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,609
An Afghan drug smuggler has been..

208
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,772
Locked up in a
Jalandhar prison for years.

209
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,144
Riaz Jutt.

210
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,848
His men bring the
stuff to the Indian border.

211
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,919
The Heroin smuggled
from Afghanistan..

212
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,082
Helps fund terrorist
operations in India.

213
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,725
Pammi and Rajinder
are responsible for..

214
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,126
For taking it out
and back to Mumbai.

215
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,594
Both of them were
state level athletes.

216
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,567
Politics, BS F, police..

217
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,929
They have contacts everywhere.

218
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,903
Your job is to reach the
consignment to the border.

219
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,339
My men will take it from there.

220
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,603
Don't worry about the police.
- Sir..

221
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,236
Who is
transporting Heroin to Mumbai?

222
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,841
Wh..which heroine, sir?

223
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,517
Madhuri or Karishma.

224
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,078
What are you talking about?

225
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:07,515
Sir.

226
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,458
Sir.. Sir, please listen to me..

227
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:23,729
I will tell you where
Rajinder and Pammi are.

228
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,302
Where do you think you are going?

229
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,844
Sir. Sir. Sir. Sir, what did I do?

230
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,378
Solan, Himachal Pradesh.

231
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,688
Nestled between the numerous local..

232
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,192
Pharmaceutical companies
is the Mandrax factory

233
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:47,996
Most of the Mandrax
available in Mumbai..

234
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,895
Is supplied from a
factory located there.

235
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,399
And the factory is
managed by Mohinder Singh.

236
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,333
Also known as Monty.

237
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:05,625
- Keep quiet.
- I'll shoot if anyone moves.

238
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,272
Sir, don't shoot, please.

239
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,479
Kunwar.. time to shut shop.

240
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,803
ACP sir!

241
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,270
Hi.
- Hello. - Maya.

242
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,714
I know.. I remember.

243
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,710
I wanted to apologize to you, sir.

244
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,750
I have misbehaved
with you three times.

245
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,222
Actually I just couldn't
imagine you as a narcotics officer.

246
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,827
I guess your operations
must be very successful, sir.

247
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,725
You look like a thug.

248
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,190
Thank you for the compliment.

249
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:14,899
I mean sometimes.. when
you feel like being one.

250
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,771
I didn't want to look like one
while returning your anklet.

251
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,473
But unfortunately.

252
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,338
Actually was..
- Under the pretext of the anklet..

253
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:25,243
I wanted to ask you your name,
address, sun sign. Right?

254
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,872
No, sir..

255
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,448
The first impression
outside the auditorium.

256
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,519
I got confused.

257
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,952
He was a drug peddler.
- I know..

258
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,620
I mean I realized later that he
had definitely done something wrong.

259
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,657
And I assure you..

260
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,700
NCB officers don't carry
anklets in their pocket.

261
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,529
Tell me.

262
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,797
Wh at?

263
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,896
You wanted to say sorry,
but you haven't.

264
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,303
I am sorry.l mean I am really,
really, sorry.

265
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,004
Your apology is accepted.

266
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,611
What brings you here?

267
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,415
The children from our NGO..

268
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,645
Are presenting a dance
drama in the function.

269
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:06,085
There are only two
things in life that scare me.

270
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,082
Dance and drama.

271
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,458
And these children are
performing both at once!

272
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,023
Brave kids.

273
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,469
Bye!
-Bye!

274
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,680
What's up He-man?

275
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,552
You aren't wearing a white
pajama and kurta for mourning today?

276
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:37,945
Why, sir?

277
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,851
Don't you know
today is the cremation?

278
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,151
Arvind's information has
finished off all the gangs.

279
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,092
Yash..

280
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:51,023
Arvind seems to be a
dependable informer.

281
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,536
Frankly I am surprised
by the information..

282
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,940
.. That the
Intelligence Bureau has on Arvind.

283
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,207
He doesn't have
any known drug links.

284
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,083
Arvind was working for a failed
software company in Andhra Pradesh.

285
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,383
He was usually
posted in other countries.

286
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,081
US, Singapore, Dubai.

287
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,050
Hello.

288
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,354
Hello, how are you?
- Fine.

289
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,793
His son died in Dubai.
Reason unknown.

290
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,862
He told me that drugs were
responsible for his son's death.

291
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,931
How can an outsider possibly
have so much sensitive information?

292
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,705
I hope his motive was
avenging a personal loss.

293
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,742
And nothing else.

294
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,244
Boss.

295
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,690
The NCB got rid of all gangs.

296
00:30:56,454 --> 00:31:00,300
Everything worked out
according to Vishnu's plan.

297
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,704
How are you, Vishnu?
- Very good, Anna.

298
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,881
Arvind has done
exactly as he was told.

299
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,874
Now it's time you came here.

300
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,144
I'll be there soon, very soon.

301
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,689
Hello?
- Yashvardhan sir.

302
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,427
Speaking, who is this?

303
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:08,062
Sir, Maya.

304
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,931
I hope l am not disturbing you.

305
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,463
Maya.. you remember, right?

306
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,001
Dance and drama! How could I forget?

307
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,470
Sir, there's a problem.

308
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,377
I'm sorry I asked you to come here.

309
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,853
It's alright.

310
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,749
Roshni. She is one of
our best local helpers.

311
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,858
Hello, Roshni,
- Hello, sir.

312
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,023
What's the problem?

313
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,893
Roshni lives at Saniay Nagar.

314
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:47,159
A group of young boys
living there often trouble her.

315
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,864
In fact they threatened her that
if she complained about this..

316
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,669
They would throw acid on her.

317
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,903
That's why I had to
stay back with her.

318
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,078
I didn't know what I should do..

319
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,148
That's why l called you.

320
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,645
Prem..

321
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,348
When I asked her name..

322
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,252
There they are.. at the tea stall.

323
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,388
Walk towards your home.

324
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,030
Sir?

325
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:18,794
Don't worry!

326
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,802
Just go.

327
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,555
She is back!

328
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,322
Hey Mother Teresa!
- Please let me go..

329
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:55,200
You think you can walk away
just by looking the other way?

330
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,536
I'm talking to you, so
don't you look away!

331
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,337
Please let me go.. -I don't
want to waste my time talking.

332
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:05,269
When the acid hits her face,
that's when she will get it.

333
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,280
No!
- You are right. - Go.

334
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:08,943
Get the bottle of acid!

335
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,781
No, please don't do that!

336
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:13,683
Oh no.. we have to do it.
- Please.

337
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,256
We have to
otherwise you won't get it!

338
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:16,824
Now I have to do it.

339
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,859
You just can't imagine
what I'm capable of.

340
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,055
Quick! Open it!
- No, please don't!

341
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,057
Since you don't seem to
get it, I have to do it.

342
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,066
Throw it?
- No, please.. please!

343
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,102
Please don't!
- I'll throw it!

344
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,281
Who is he?

345
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,152
Seems like a police officer.

346
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,925
No, sir.

347
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:58,962
No, oh no, sir..

348
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,826
Sir.. we were just kidding..

349
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,063
It's not acid..

350
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,639
It's only tap water.

351
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:06,935
Look at this.

352
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,143
I was also kidding.

353
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,986
It's a gun but no bullets.

354
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,231
You can drop me here.

355
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:32,828
Here? -Yes.

356
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,969
Sir..

357
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,540
What if it really were acid?

358
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:48,142
I know what a goon's
capable of when I see one.

359
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:51,947
What if the bottle did contain acid?

360
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,184
It would have burnt my face.

361
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,788
I get the shivers thinking about it.

362
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,691
And you're so casual about it.

363
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,598
Thank God it wasn't!

364
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:18,805
Yes, Atul?

365
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,210
We have just arrived.

366
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,680
We are below the building.

367
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,548
Okay bye.

368
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,285
ACP sir..

369
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,459
Hi.
- Hello.

370
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:40,031
My friend and I were at the
coffee shop and I saw you.

371
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:44,469
Would you like to join us?
- Sorry, I'm slightly busy.

372
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,571
There's a hearing at the NDPS court.

373
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,268
Well.. come after you are done.

374
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,039
We'll wait for you.

375
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,972
When did a rose bloom on
this dried log of wood?

376
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:54,883
I don't know when that would be..

377
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,212
I am not sure.

378
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:57,985
Please don't wait for me..

379
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,185
Please carry on. Okay?

380
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,950
Okay.

381
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,184
Bye.

382
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:06,183
Bye.

383
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,432
So I guess now we will
have to salute her too?

384
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:31,613
Oh no.

385
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,456
Kamlesh. Kamlesh. Give her a hand.

386
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,065
Please.. get out of the way..

387
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:47,795
Mahesh, get the car..
- Yes sir.

388
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:16,586
ACP sir..

389
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,155
How are you?

390
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,227
I should be the one asking you that.

391
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,359
I was avoiding that very question.

392
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,294
I'm not good at lying.

393
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,333
It hurts a lot.

394
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,574
Don't worry, you'll be alright.

395
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,602
Let me call the doctor.

396
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,271
Don't blame me for losing the case.

397
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,010
If you had agreed to have coffee..

398
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,712
You wouldn't have gotten
involved in the 'Save Maya Mission'.

399
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,917
Don't worry, we won the case.

400
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,391
There's no need to be
so serious about it.

401
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,221
I was kidding.

402
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:57,996
I was looking at you and
didn't notice the car.

403
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:02,368
Here's the file.
- Thanks. - it's okay.

404
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:06,770
Let's go, sir.

405
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,504
Why do you have your
clothes ironed so crisp?

406
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,311
They could cut like a knife!

407
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,408
Here you go again.

408
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,747
Yash, has gone to that hospital?

409
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,185
You know something..

410
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,088
Atul and Swati are married.

411
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:26,624
And you are content
going around with Rachna.

412
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,590
That leaves Yash and me.

413
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,097
Now, he is totally into
that girl at the hospital.

414
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:33,532
God isn't paying attention to me.

415
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,631
Probably because I'm dark.

416
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:37,972
But this is the end of Yash.

417
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:41,537
No, sir. Yash isn't like that.

418
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,645
But the girl sure is.

419
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:46,146
Even I knew one who
had met with an accident.

420
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,682
I ran to her..

421
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,547
Held her in my arms.. and
took her to the hospital.

422
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,946
But her husband
came to take her back.

423
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:58,724
It should be compulsory for
married girls to wear a mangalsutra.

424
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,585
So have you made
your hospital pass yet?

425
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:01,662
Wh at?

426
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,787
I mean, you spend
most of your time there.

427
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,229
You should have an Attendant Pass.

428
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:07,393
Swati, I've been to
the hospital only twice.

429
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:10,097
That's good. Or you
could fall in love.

430
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,138
Just focus on your work.

431
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,467
Come on, Swati! I feel guilty.

432
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:14,941
The accident happened because of me.

433
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,308
That's why I went.
- I know, very sad.

434
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,472
In fact, Mahesh said
something but I didn't believe him.

435
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,174
Though now.. I don't know.

436
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:22,580
What did he say?

437
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,011
I mean, he said that..

438
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:26,588
.Awhile taking Maya to the hospital
something went into your eyes..

439
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,986
And perhaps your eyes
were wet or something..

440
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,490
I.. I don't remember.

441
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,088
I was worried you know.

442
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,524
Hey loser!

443
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:36,063
If you act human will
you be less of a man?

444
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:37,324
'I was worried.'

445
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,094
I know you've been there twice but..

446
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,998
Mentally that's where you are.

447
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,001
Why can't you admit it?

448
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,572
Why can't you admit that you
have fallen in love with her?

449
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,038
Love?

450
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:47,266
Swati..

451
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,671
I don't think I'll
ever see her again.

452
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,216
ACP sir.

453
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:06,923
When I was in
college I had an ambition.

454
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:09,554
That I should get at least
one fracture, a hairline..

455
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:10,688
On the left arm..

456
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:14,893
The boys would shower me
with attention, the sympathy.

457
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,095
The accident took
place a little late though.

458
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,367
Wrong time, wrong side, wrong limb..

459
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:22,171
But still, I like it.

460
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,374
Everyone has written
some cute message..

461
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,546
You want to try your hand?

462
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,315
ACP sir?

463
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:35,354
Something bothering you?

464
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:49,466
Wow!

465
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:54,873
Nowadays visitors
bring fruits, bouquets..

466
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:58,369
But this is special.

467
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,248
Thank you for the gun, ACP sir.

468
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:06,019
Just.. just toking!

469
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,312
So, ACP sir..

470
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:10,755
Are you this awkward
around every girl or..

471
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,725
Is there something special about me?

472
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,731
Normally the girls I
meet are either carriers..

473
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,628
..Peddlers, users or informers.

474
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,461
And I am very comfortable with them.

475
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,235
So, you are
uncomfortable because l am normal?

476
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,506
No.. I mean..

477
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,468
I'm uncomfortable..

478
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:30,810
Because of this chair.

479
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,547
The chair?

480
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,073
Yes.

481
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,444
Hi Sister..

482
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:36,710
Hello..

483
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,843
ACP Yash..

484
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,154
Let me get some tea for you.

485
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,125
Reverse case.

486
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,190
Your sister is
uncomfortable around me.

487
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,024
Sir, don't mind this but..

488
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,763
People are often
uncomfortable around the police.

489
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,528
We are normal people.

490
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,967
We are normal people
and I'm a normal person.

491
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:03,509
Right! So you're normal?

492
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,749
Time will tell how
normal you really are.

493
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:26,788
Vishnu!

494
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:32,090
I had almost given up.

495
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,960
But I didn't.

496
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:36,664
I can't help it.

497
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,339
I can't stay away from you for long.

498
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:42,772
Let's go.

499
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:48,280
I'm so glad you're back, Vishnu.

500
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,786
What's the next step?

501
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:57,721
The field is clean and
competition is zero.

502
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,920
Demand is at an all time high.

503
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:02,859
Now, we will do business..

504
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,531
And together we will rule India.

505
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:07,795
But there's only one problem.

506
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:08,995
What's that?

507
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,807
You know what,I am so bored.

508
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,311
I've wasted four weeks of my life,
doing nothing at home.

509
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,107
Nothing interesting on TV and..

510
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,515
The walls don't change
color if you stare at them.

511
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,246
Now the weekend is here.

512
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:28,953
I'm going to Panchgani,
to visit Sister.

513
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:30,616
I miss her.

514
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,223
ACP sir..

515
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,627
Will you come along?

516
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,633
When are you leaving, Yash?
- I'm not.

517
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:40,201
You better go!

518
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,600
You will regret it when she
invites you for her wedding.

519
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:44,134
No problem , I'll enjoy the buffet.

520
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,569
Yash, listen to me!

521
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,004
Things are under control here.

522
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,269
You could use a break.

523
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,873
I love you, Atul!

524
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:52,675
You too, Brutus?

525
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:56,108
Come on! Even your junior agrees.
- Yes. Go, Yash.

526
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,277
I don't want to go!
Just stop it both of you!

527
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:32,452
"We both don't express the
feelings in our hearts."

528
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:38,058
"You wish to be mine and so do I."

529
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:42,753
"We know yet we act so strangely
What kind of a story is this?"

530
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:50,396
"isn't this surprising. When
there's love then why not admit it?"

531
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:57,704
"We both don't express the
feelings in our hearts."

532
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:03,217
"You wish to be mine and so do I."

533
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:07,778
"We know yet we act so strangely
What kind of a story is this?"

534
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:15,387
"isn't this surprising. When
there's love then why not admit it?"

535
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:46,851
"When the hearts say that
we have to be together."

536
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:52,525
"When the hearts beat
then what's the problem?"

537
00:49:55,192 --> 00:50:01,666
"Your habit of staying
silent is my only complaint."

538
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:06,544
"Express sometimes the
desires in your heart."

539
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:12,018
"The secret that's
hidden in my heart."

540
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:18,025
"Let's tell it to the entire world."

541
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:27,158
"We both don't express the
feelings in our hearts."

542
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:32,740
"You wish to be mine and so do I."

543
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:37,312
"We know yet we act so strangely
What kind of a story is this?"

544
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:44,580
"isn't this surprising. When
there's love then why not admit it?"

545
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:51,626
"Now that we are together
then why this distance."

546
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:56,130
"Though close yet we are far."

547
00:50:56,887 --> 00:51:02,394
"Why are we both scared?
Why are we both hesitant?"

548
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:07,168
"Wonder why we are so helpless?"

549
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:12,645
I don't believe there is any
place On earth as beautiful as this

550
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:15,673
And, even if 1:here is one,
it doesn't matter to me.

551
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:18,212
My father built this house.

552
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:19,885
When my parents were alive..

553
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:22,957
..We used to spend
every weekend together here

554
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:27,390
Good times, bad times,
we've lived them all over here.

555
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:31,289
I wanted to show you this place.

556
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,504
I had a great time..

557
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:39,333
Thanks.

558
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,938
It's quite late, we should leave.

559
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:46,373
Wh at?

560
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:49,283
There's something
I need to tell you.

561
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:59,087
I know something about
you that no one knows.

562
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:00,818
Wh at?

563
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:02,751
This no nonsense serious face...

564
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:05,528
Image so that criminals fear you.

565
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,795
But you're very soft
and sensitive inside.

566
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:11,005
Maya.. - I noticed it on
the day of the accident.

567
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,466
You helped me into the car..

568
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:15,440
Placed my head in your lap..

569
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,702
Tried to control the bleeding.

570
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,871
Maya, anyone at that
moment would've done the same.

571
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:24,242
But would that 'anyone'
have tears in his eyes?

572
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:31,415
I was conscious and I could see.

573
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:35,285
Slowly, slowly I
lost consciousness.

574
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:38,722
But I was sure I wouldn't die.

575
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,296
I kept hoping that
when I open my eyes..

576
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,898
I should see you.

577
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,971
That's exactly what happened.

578
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,782
I took very long to
get to the point..

579
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,717
And even the sun is
bored and setting.

580
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,423
Okay, let me come to the point.

581
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:05,555
I love you!

582
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,251
There I said it.

583
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:13,762
You shouldn't have..

584
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,035
I think I might have led you on.

585
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:20,372
I shouldn't have sent the roses.

586
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,135
I think we are friends.

587
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:24,711
Why do we need to
define our relationship?

588
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:27,173
But let's not call it love.

589
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:35,516
Did I blackmail you with my tears?

590
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:40,488
Did I seduce you by dancing in
the rain wearing a white saree?

591
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:43,663
Did I hold your hand while
referring to you as a 'friend"?

592
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,490
I could've done that.

593
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:48,468
In fad, any girl
would've done it, but I didn't.

594
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,032
I was honest about
my feelings for you.

595
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:56,669
I didn't ask you what
you thought about me.

596
00:53:57,033 --> 00:54:00,571
I didn't even ask
whether or not you love me!

597
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:05,214
I told you what I felt.

598
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:14,658
Yashvardhan, I sort of
expected your reply.

599
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:19,257
That's why l didn't
ask you any question.

600
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:25,297
Let's go.

601
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:38,718
She is so right!

602
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,983
What makes you think you are normal?

603
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,148
I can't lose focus, Swati.

604
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,190
Don't married officers work?

605
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:48,728
But they are all distracted.

606
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:50,991
I can see it on their faces.

607
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:56,331
You are a coward,
Yash. You are scared.

608
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,269
Not letting someone into your
life due to fear of the unknown..

609
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,504
Is escapism, not bravery!

610
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:17,755
Outside the auditorium.

611
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,089
This is special.

612
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,860
Anyway, let's meet at
the rehearsal tomorrow.

613
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,130
Bye!

614
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:33,770
Catch me.

615
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,510
ACP sir..

616
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:41,712
What a surprise! Are
you here to see me?

617
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,476
Do I know anyone else here?

618
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,312
I need to talk to you.

619
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:46,352
Can we..?

620
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:47,513
Sure.

621
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,351
Talking to you is always a pleasure.

622
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,253
Com e.

623
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,307
Do you know why l called you here?

624
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:10,737
Definitely not for a kiss?

625
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,172
Wow.

626
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:17,150
The first thing that came
to your mind was a kiss.

627
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:23,421
It's all about sex, right?

628
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,353
Body, height, weight look good
to you and you call it love.

629
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,859
Apart from height, body and weight..

630
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,892
You also wept for me.

631
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:37,571
That's not enough.
- What do you mean?

632
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:41,100
What do you even know about me?

633
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,773
People say things behind my back,
sometimes even when I am around..

634
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,938
They call me stiff and boring.

635
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:48,648
But that makes no difference to me.

636
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:50,782
You can say all you want..

637
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,647
But I won't change.

638
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:57,023
Why' would I change a
great item like you?

639
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:58,686
You think I'm nuts to do that?

640
00:56:58,915 --> 00:56:59,985
Item ?

641
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:03,461
These days girls
think of guys as an item!

642
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:07,732
If the item flexes his muscles,
you're happy.

643
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:10,637
If the item steps out of a
swimming pool and strikes a pose..

644
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:12,271
You're happy--

645
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:16,469
I'm happy even if you take your
sunglasses off and give me that look!

646
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:19,913
What if tomorrow the item
is on duty 24 hours a day?

647
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:23,349
And if he doesn't answer
your call, every time you call..

648
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,575
What then?

649
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:28,587
If he raids the night club
where you're dancing what then?

650
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:31,751
And if the item arrests me..

651
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,318
I'm okay with that too.

652
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:37,523
Everything is fair in love.

653
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,095
What do you want, Maya?

654
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:40,926
What do you want from me?

655
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:48,572
I want to spend my
entire life with you.

656
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,114
Spend every moment with you,
be happy with you.

657
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:55,940
Keep talking to you..

658
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,350
Sometimes argue with you.

659
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:02,221
Rest my head on
your shoulder and cry.

660
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:07,753
Remain as madly in love with
you tomorrow as I am today.

661
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:12,966
And like every other girl,
I want so much more.

662
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:17,368
I want to make love to you.

663
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,603
I want to look into
your eyes every day

664
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:25,872
And one day..

665
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:28,677
Close my eyes and..

666
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:34,043
Peacefully die in your arms.

667
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:39,989
That's all I want!

668
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:48,034
I love you!

669
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:53,101
I always have.

670
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:56,277
From the moment I first saw you.

671
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:59,606
But I was lying..

672
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:02,407
Lying to myself and to you.

673
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:05,111
That's why I didn't want to say it.

674
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,348
Will you marry me?

675
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:14,184
No.

676
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:05,201
"My dreams seem lost,
they seem bewildered."

677
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:12,685
"There are faded signs on the path."

678
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:23,162
"When you are my companion
everything seems beautiful."

679
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:26,665
"This land shines
brighter than the moon."

680
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:32,068
"All trails seem to
lead towards love."

681
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:40,941
"My dreams seem lost,
they seem bewildered."

682
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:48,546
"There are faded signs on the path."

683
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:55,655
"How do I convey? I
am at loss of words."

684
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:24,954
"Now that we have met.
I have new intentions."

685
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:32,232
"Why won't there be
restlessness in my heart."

686
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:39,406
"I am crazy. I always
listen to my heart."

687
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:46,479
"I am wherever you are.
We are both crazy."

688
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:53,587
"May this passion never die down.
May we lead our lives just like this."

689
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:59,920
"We will express
whatever our heart says."

690
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:07,591
"My dreams seem lost,
they seem bewildered."

691
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:15,332
"There are faded signs on the path."

692
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:32,320
"My dreams seem lost,
they seem bewildered."

693
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:39,462
"There are faded signs on the path."

694
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:43,363
"When you are my companion
everything seems beautiful."

695
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:46,906
"This land shines
brighter than the moon."

696
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:51,445
"All trails seem to
lead towards love."

697
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:14,424
This information is all useless.

698
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:17,761
But this file could be useful.

699
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:22,971
With the help of Arvind's information
these four wiped out four gangs.

700
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,781
Arvind could have led them to us.

701
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,472
That would have
been dangerous for us.

702
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:30,240
Sol killed him..

703
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,878
But these four are still alive.

704
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:36,717
I want detailed information
about them and their families.

705
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:39,184
We aren't inviting
them for a family dinner.

706
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:41,385
The com petition is dead.

707
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:43,121
Forget about them!

708
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,755
We shouldn't forget about them.

709
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:47,525
Like a lion..

710
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,997
What do you mean?
- Lion.

711
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:57,874
Lions always turn and look
back after taking five steps.

712
01:03:58,734 --> 01:03:59,940
Just to make sure
there is no one behind.

713
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:03,410
The plan to fake my
death in Mombasa..

714
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:05,380
And wipe out the competition..

715
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:07,888
Were the first two
steps in my foolproof plan.

716
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:11,624
But if I make a mistake
after the third step..

717
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:13,457
And look over my shoulder..

718
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:15,653
These four will be there.

719
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,892
I am aware of their strength.

720
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:20,200
Now I need to know their weaknesses.

721
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:22,295
What is..

722
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:26,072
So, the wedding date is confirmed.
23rd of March.

723
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,103
A month to go.. we have to wait!

724
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:29,970
But that's fine, we can go shopping.

725
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:31,270
Shopping.

726
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,309
Why are you so stiff around them?

727
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,579
It looks like you are still
uncomfortable around them.

728
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,217
Please! They are
not police officers.

729
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,410
They are with the NCB.

730
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:49,352
So..

731
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:54,528
Finally another one bites the dust!

732
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,799
Couldn't help it, I fell in love.

733
01:04:57,927 --> 01:04:58,997
Well.. it happens.

734
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:02,172
I have become weak.
- No way, Yash. it's not weakness.

735
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:08,472
I have the information
but they are undercover..

736
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:10,709
That's why the photos aren't clear.

737
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,146
Atul Kalsekar..

738
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:17,488
Lives in Vile Parle and is married.

739
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:19,883
Mahesh.

740
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:22,154
He has been transferred from
the Delhi income tax branch and..

741
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:24,426
He has a girlfriend,Rachna.

742
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:25,860
She works at a call center.

743
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:29,296
Kamlesh, is a little crazy.

744
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:31,827
His mother lives in Ralegoan Siddhi.

745
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:34,633
..And the fourth?

746
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:42,444
He has no one to call
his own and no weakness.

747
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:45,914
My being alone was my strength.

748
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:52,522
Eight years as a fearless cop and
there was nothing to hold me back.

749
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:54,821
No one to care about.

750
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:56,624
No one to worry about.

751
01:05:58,821 --> 01:05:59,891
Impossible!

752
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:02,393
Every human has a weak spot.

753
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:04,135
But now there's Maya.

754
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:07,374
Perhaps Maya will
become my weakness.

755
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:09,806
We only need to find it.

756
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:13,540
And that will
affect his every breath.

757
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:37,394
Vishnu, you
should've stayed at home.

758
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:38,730
In a hotel it's..

759
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:41,341
The fact that I am here is
only known to us and our men.

760
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,974
For the rest of the world,
Vishnu was killed in Mombasa.

761
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,873
When drug mules and couriers..

762
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:47,948
..Are captured the
loss is negligible..

763
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:50,745
And if they aren't captured,
the profit isn't a lot either.

764
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:53,116
That's why we will
send a very big shipment.

765
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:54,483
Of..?
- Ketamine.

766
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:56,645
The rate in Chennai is
35 thousand per kilo.

767
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:59,224
And in Kenya it
fetches one million per kilo.

768
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:04,290
One sack of Ketamine in a
genuine cargo export at a time.

769
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:06,627
And a profit of a 100 million!

770
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,531
But money always leaves a trail.

771
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:11,931
The NCB and DRI are
hot on this trail.

772
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:14,541
But our deal won't involve money

773
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:17,004
We'll send Acetic
Anhydrite to Afganistan and..

774
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:19,610
In return we will
get arms and heroin.

775
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:21,179
Some of that will be sold
in the local market and..

776
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:22,874
The rest packed off to Europe.

777
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:25,312
And in return for that Grade 4
heroin which sells in Europe..

778
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:28,319
We will get cocaine in Mumbai.

779
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:31,054
The heroin will be sent to
Belgium in moulded furniture and..

780
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:34,885
The cocaine will be
transported to Mumbai inside timber.

781
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:37,425
Final step we will plough the
cash we receive from the peddlers..

782
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,863
Into the construction
business and get clean funds.

783
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:41,426
That it is, Anna.

784
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:45,973
No one apart from me
can supply cocaine.

785
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:47,830
Place, money, time..

786
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,375
Will be my decision.

787
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,896
Sir, it's cocaine, not heroin.

788
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:10,053
An overdose..

789
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:13,099
Possibly because it was much purer
than what's normally available here.

790
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:16,899
How did such quality
suddenly become so easily available?

791
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:25,277
Grade four purity heroin..

792
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:27,574
Is being sold for the price of
grade three stuff in Mumbai.

793
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:29,339
White for the price of brown.

794
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:31,151
Probably a new dealer in town.

795
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:32,750
And he is making his presence felt.

796
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:35,047
The peddlers don't have a
clue about the suppliers.

797
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:36,882
A telemarketing system is in place.

798
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,251
Need cocaine?

799
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:40,527
We'll confirm the place,
time and price.

800
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:42,827
They collect the
cash at one location..

801
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:44,554
And drop the stuff at another.

802
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:47,465
Belgium
Antwerp Airport.

803
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,564
70 kilos.

804
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:52,039
Canada, Montreal airport..

805
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:53,466
20 kilos.

806
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,103
Flights came in from Mumbai.

807
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:58,644
It means the same grade four
heroin that is shipped abroad..

808
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:00,111
Is also distributed locally.

809
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:03,550
Indian exports to Belgium are
a lot lesser than to Canada.

810
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:05,816
Figure out from the freight movers..

811
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:07,888
Who sends regular
consignments to Antwerp.

812
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:11,750
You were right.

813
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:15,624
He wasn't trying to help us..

814
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,521
He was getting rid
of his competition.

815
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:20,692
Arvind.

816
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:23,562
We need to be more cautious.

817
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,568
Arvind's trail could go cold.

818
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:28,140
Tell me, has Arvind ever
paid with his credit card?

819
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:29,607
No, sir, it was always cash.

820
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:31,939
What did he submit as ID proof?
- His passport, sir.

821
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:35,740
It's an address in Hyderabad.

822
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:38,383
I've informed the people in Delhi.
I'll get local help.

823
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:46,351
Atul,where are you?

824
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:47,756
Vishakapatnam.

825
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,423
Got Arvind?
- Yes!

826
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:55,066
There was a ticket to
the US at Arvind's place.

827
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:56,703
He has a multiple entry visa.

828
01:09:56,825 --> 01:09:58,429
Why would he go to Vishakapatnam?

829
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:00,004
I guess Arvind was promised that..

830
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:02,234
..He would be sent to
the US after the deal.

831
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:04,000
Instead they killed him

832
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:07,638
He knew about all
the local gangs here.

833
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:10,040
We got rid of the competition.

834
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,914
With demand being
high and supply low..

835
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:15,284
He sold stuff worth billions.

836
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:22,085
Sir, there's a furniture exporter..

837
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:23,962
Tahir Mirza.

838
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,231
Send 50 kilos with this to Belgium.

839
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:28,393
These are his export invoices, sir.

840
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:30,434
Why should Reddy make all the money?

841
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:33,031
Send it to the clients in Belgium.

842
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:35,636
His Belgian clients
aren't buying the furniture..

843
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,377
But the heroin concealed inside.

844
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:39,605
He exports a couch
for 5000 Euro and..

845
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,472
A coffee table for 2000 Euro.

846
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:43,914
Moreover, the
timber that's imported..

847
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:45,382
..Is hardly used at all.

848
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:46,976
Why does he even import it?

849
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:55,091
He isn't buying the timber
but the stuff within it.

850
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:59,225
Look at how well it is polished.

851
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:02,193
Even the police
sniffer dogs can't catch us.

852
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:06,004
Where is this furniture workshop?

853
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:17,147
So Tahirbhai..

854
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:20,853
Do you run this operation yourself..

855
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:23,655
Or do you have an
expert panel behind you?

856
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,986
When I was in
construction I met Reddy.

857
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:34,332
He told me that bricks and stones
weren't as lucrative as powder.

858
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:38,537
We invested the profits in
the retail space.. into malls.

859
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:45,436
Gurgaon, Hyderabad and..

860
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:48,707
Now there's a mall
coming up in Mumbai.

861
01:11:57,713 --> 01:12:01,058
Jean Pierre will bring the Cocaine
with him for the inauguration.

862
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:28,648
At the inauguration..

863
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:31,457
Reddy will pick up the Cocaine.

864
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:36,888
Alone?

865
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:38,523
Of course alone!

866
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:42,030
You don't look well, Anna.

867
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:44,969
I will be fine when
I see the cocaine.

868
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,504
But Anna.. - it's the
same deal as always, Vishnu,

869
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:49,401
heroin in exchange for cocaine.

870
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:53,010
Since it is the first deal it
is better to do it in person.

871
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:58,344
I told you that you
didn't need to com e.

872
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:01,452
It hasn't been easy
getting you back, Vishnu.

873
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:05,086
Go.. be a part of the crowd.

874
01:13:06,181 --> 01:13:07,455
Just watch.

875
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:14,993
I will be there when
the deal takes place.

876
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,465
That will help you pick us out.

877
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:53,370
The deal will take
place on the second floor..

878
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:55,572
At an electronics store.

879
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:32,074
That's where the heroin and
cocaine will change hands.

880
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:10,375
Freeze.

881
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:34,730
Move it! Out. Out.

882
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:35,968
Catch him. Catch him.

883
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:38,133
Trying to run. Stop.

884
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:39,507
Hold him. Hold him.

885
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:07,899
Reddy! Stop..

886
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:10,400
Don't move. Don't move.

887
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:11,704
Raise your hands!

888
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:13,404
Raise your hands!

889
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,348
Okay I'll surrender.

890
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:26,248
I'm keeping it on the floor.
- Now! Arrest..

891
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,656
Arrest me. I'm keeping it down.
- Keep it down.

892
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:30,456
I don't have anything.

893
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:32,498
I had a bag but I threw it away.

894
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:33,793
I don't have any money on me.

895
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,598
Now keep trying your luck in court!

896
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,397
Who says I'm going to arrest you?

897
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:40,871
Yash, calm down.

898
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:43,170
Yash, calm down. We will
get Tahir's testimony..

899
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,471
We will find the bag in the mall.

900
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:46,671
You can't imagine how
powerful this guy is.

901
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,611
He can hire any
lawyer at the NDPS court.

902
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:50,239
He fired his gun, let's shoot him.

903
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:53,251
Oh come on.. are you the
NCB or encounter specialist?

904
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:54,980
Shut up! Don't say a word.
- Arrest me, will you?

905
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:58,216
13 days ago a 19 year old
boy and 21 year old girl died..

906
01:16:58,313 --> 01:16:59,553
Due to your cocaine.

907
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:02,025
Stop lecturing and arrest me.

908
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:03,924
Yash, don't shoot.

909
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:06,692
Keep an eye on him.
- Yash we need him alive.

910
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:08,630
Yash we need him alive.

911
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:11,831
Yash, you don't understand...
I'm going to kill him.

912
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:00,784
I have no regrets, sir.

913
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:03,845
How many criminals like
Reddy have you brought..

914
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:06,016
Before the Human
Rights Inquiry Commission?

915
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:08,294
If you had done so,
you'd have realized..

916
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:09,691
That they are hardly human.

917
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:11,487
Sir, you are overlooking the facts.

918
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,361
When shots were
fired from both sides..

919
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:15,866
Many prominent citizens of
this city were present there.

920
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:18,935
For some strange reason,
maybe they are too busy..

921
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:22,069
None of them submitted their
observation before this commission.

922
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:24,042
Our government has already
spent 20 million rupees..

923
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:25,941
..On terrorists like Kasab..

924
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:27,611
And now it wants to
spend another 20 million..

925
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,273
..On an unofficial
terrorist like Reddy?

926
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,345
We just did the same job
with two hundred rupee bullets.

927
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:34,019
If there's a
similar situation again..

928
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:35,846
I would do the same thing again.

929
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:41,352
According to deceased's
widow Saundarya Reddy..

930
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,361
And Vasuvelchitti's petition..

931
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:45,222
You could've arrested him.

932
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,056
Is it true, Mr. Kalsekar?

933
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:48,693
Yes, sir.

934
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:52,802
We could've captured Reddy alive.

935
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:04,443
Tahir was selling heroin
behind our backs and..

936
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:06,080
That's why he was caught.

937
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:10,619
He snitched about Anna and
is now a police witness.

938
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:17,387
Where can I find him?

939
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:21,428
NCB has kept him in protective
custody, somewhere close to Mumbai.

940
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,533
Where exactly?

941
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:27,065
Bala, talk to him..

942
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:30,304
Tell him to lie low for
a few days.. - I can't!

943
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:32,743
My brother is dead.

944
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:36,881
Vishnu, for all practical
reasons you don't exist.

945
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:38,745
I will be the prime suspect.

946
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:41,385
Bala..
- Let me explain.

947
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:44,890
What does he mean to you?

948
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:48,327
Nothing, I mean, he works for me.

949
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,758
What's his name?

950
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:51,863
Ajay.
-Ajay.

951
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:53,898
Yes.
- Now, imagine Ajay is your brother.

952
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,560
I don't understand.

953
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:56,930
Let me explain.

954
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:04,035
Vishnu!

955
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:06,870
So I killed Ajay,
who was your brother.

956
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:09,272
You know this fact..

957
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:12,351
But you don't know my whereabouts.

958
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:16,854
So what if someone refuses to
help you with that information..

959
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:18,555
What will you do?

960
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:22,187
Precisely what l will do to you.

961
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:26,354
I will.. see what I can do, Vishnu.

962
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:27,524
Good.

963
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:32,028
You go after Tahir, I
will deal with the NCB.

964
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:44,079
After my first suspension,
even I was restless like that.

965
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:50,216
This is not fair, sir.

966
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:52,124
Reddy wasn't a social worker.

967
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:53,757
I mean, we got suspended for him!

968
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:55,618
Hey He-man!

969
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:59,822
Come on, sit. You've got
to enjoy these moments.

970
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:01,457
Relax Mahesh, come sit.

971
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:04,163
As part of my team, you can
look forward to more suspensions!

972
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:05,632
Losers!

973
01:21:06,461 --> 01:21:07,735
What's this ACP sir?

974
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:10,066
I thought the
operation was successful.

975
01:21:10,165 --> 01:21:12,406
Probably get a
promotion before the wedding..

976
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:14,375
Instead he got suspended.

977
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:16,439
Now I have to look after him.

978
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,548
Yes, but only 50%. I
will get 50% of my salary

979
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:20,584
First of all, he's not even corrupt.

980
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:22,378
And on top of that, only 50% pay!

981
01:21:23,178 --> 01:21:24,714
Just my luck!

982
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:29,592
Madam, you'll get
more time together.

983
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:31,828
Wedding, honeymoon,
make the most of it!

984
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:33,489
It's my luck that's bad..

985
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:34,996
I don't even have a girlfriend.

986
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:38,002
I did have one but back
then I wasn't suspended.

987
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:42,602
Tell me something, how
did you meet our He-man?

988
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:45,108
What, sir?
- Okay, bye.

989
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:47,242
Atul and Swati are also coming.
- Oh..

990
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:50,473
Do you know that Swati
isn't talking to Atul?

991
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:52,077
Swati should understand.

992
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:53,977
Everybody knows that
Atul is serious about work.

993
01:21:54,309 --> 01:21:56,016
If he sees that
anybody is out of line..

994
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:57,656
He will stand by the rules.

995
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,851
He'll even have the
zonal director suspended.

996
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:02,526
Let's go?
- Yes.

997
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:06,158
Well, I see its time to
terminate the mission.

998
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:09,531
I can do this.
- You already had.

999
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:13,265
You give me good usable intel..

1000
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:15,270
..To this whole place.

1001
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:19,644
Yeah, I got them by the balls
with that when this turns into a..

1002
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:42,433
So, you like photography?

1003
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:45,463
No. What makes you say that?

1004
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:49,170
Well,just took a wild
guess given this dark room.

1005
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:52,204
Actually I prefer the darkness.

1006
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:57,576
It won't be around for long.

1007
01:22:57,906 --> 01:22:59,408
I also prefer silence.

1008
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:02,187
You can kiss that goodbye!

1009
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:04,356
I don't mind drawing the
curtains once in a while..

1010
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:06,492
But silence? No way!

1011
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:16,764
Mother.
- Hold them .

1012
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:19,370
Who are you? What
are you doing here?

1013
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:21,330
No, Vishnu, don't.

1014
01:23:25,066 --> 01:23:27,672
Vishnu? In Kenya weren't you..

1015
01:23:28,236 --> 01:23:29,340
I didn't die.

1016
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:33,552
I didn't die in Mombasa or at
the mall where you led the NCB.

1017
01:23:33,808 --> 01:23:35,082
It was a mistake..

1018
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:37,317
I made a mistake.

1019
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:40,392
No, no, no. Vishnu, let
me go. I made a mistake.

1020
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:42,859
Vishnu. I made a mistake! Vishnu.
Please forgive me.

1021
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:45,657
It was a mistake..

1022
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:47,629
And now you have to pay for it.

1023
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:49,029
Bala..
- Yes, boss.

1024
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:51,365
Kill them all.
- No, no!

1025
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:52,802
Vishnu, I am responsible.

1026
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:55,465
Don't kill them.
Punish me for everything.

1027
01:23:55,563 --> 01:23:56,769
You don't get it.

1028
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:58,375
I am punishing you.

1029
01:23:58,466 --> 01:23:59,570
Bala!

1030
01:24:05,607 --> 01:24:08,713
The more you cry, the more
your sorrow will decrease.

1031
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:12,490
And I don't want
your sorrow to decrease.

1032
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:21,460
Darkness.. silence..

1033
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:23,164
Distance!

1034
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:27,101
Even after suspension you
don't stop behaving like an AC P?

1035
01:24:28,296 --> 01:24:29,639
If I were you..

1036
01:24:29,964 --> 01:24:31,739
I'd be sitting next to me.

1037
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,377
I'd flirt a little bit.

1038
01:24:35,103 --> 01:24:37,242
Start by holding your hand..

1039
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:40,319
..And you just can't
imagine where it would stop!

1040
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:45,482
Why are you the way you are?

1041
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:47,053
Some of us are born like that.

1042
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:49,685
Manufacturing defect..

1043
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:52,058
No tragic past.

1044
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:55,292
Even so..

1045
01:24:55,723 --> 01:24:57,794
I'm still a little curious.

1046
01:24:58,326 --> 01:25:02,866
All this focus and passion..
without a past?

1047
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:06,074
Why are you fighting so
hard without any appreciation?

1048
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:09,915
First the IPS,then the
crime branch and now the NCB.

1049
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:11,108
Why?

1050
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:13,714
You don't have a past..

1051
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,555
Then why are you
working with an NGO?

1052
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:20,086
Being happy and spreading
happiness is my problem.

1053
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:22,690
What's your problem?

1054
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:27,624
So.. why do I do what l do?

1055
01:25:35,763 --> 01:25:37,572
These days parents
don't harbor dreams that..

1056
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:39,736
Their children will loin
the army or police force.

1057
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:43,840
They want their kids to
participate in reality shows..

1058
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:46,878
And become dancing
singing superstars.

1059
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:49,321
Then who will do this job?

1060
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:55,086
Today a teenager buying
heroin in a night club..

1061
01:25:55,216 --> 01:25:57,253
Doesn't realize that..

1062
01:25:57,385 --> 01:26:01,197
The money he spent on the
heroin was probably funding..

1063
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:04,031
At least one bullet fired in
a terrorist attack in Mumbai.

1064
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:10,968
Hello?

1065
01:26:11,099 --> 01:26:13,272
Tahir and his family
members have been killed.

1066
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:22,913
Yes, Atul?
- Yes.

1067
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,616
Someone avenged reddy's death.

1068
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:29,491
Well that means the construction
king's drug ring is still active.

1069
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:30,888
I guess so.

1070
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:33,995
Inform your boss and
the home ministry..

1071
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:37,168
To have a human rights
inquiry for Tahir and his family.

1072
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:38,498
Oh come on, Yash!

1073
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,665
What do you expect me to say?

1074
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:42,568
Never mind.

1075
01:26:50,638 --> 01:26:52,777
Hello?
- Heard about Tahir?

1076
01:26:54,075 --> 01:26:55,145
Who is this?

1077
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:58,422
I'm the one who is in
your thoughts right now.

1078
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,194
Tahir shouldn't
have turned inform er.

1079
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:04,089
He did and he was killed.

1080
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:09,027
The four of you
shouldn't have killed Anna.

1081
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,568
But you did.

1082
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:13,801
Big mistake.

1083
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:16,567
Now, all four of you will die.

1084
01:27:17,532 --> 01:27:18,602
Another thing..

1085
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:21,345
I hope you have watched
your last film with that girl.

1086
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:25,040
Because after I kill you,
I will kidnap her.

1087
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,511
And make sure your agony
continues even after death.

1088
01:27:27,842 --> 01:27:28,980
Who is this?

1089
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:30,723
ACP Yashvardhan..

1090
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:36,085
Once l tell you my name,
you will never forget it.

1091
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:45,135
Bhargav, this isn't an
official request yet.

1092
01:27:45,226 --> 01:27:46,933
I want to know where
the call originated.

1093
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:48,835
Yadav
- Yes sir.

1094
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:50,767
Go for a stroll in the alley.

1095
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:52,844
See if someone is out there.
- Okay, sir.

1096
01:27:56,404 --> 01:27:58,281
Yes, Yash !?
- I think I have got your man.

1097
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:02,914
Send a message to all
the lO's and constables.

1098
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,019
Ask them to meet me near my home.

1099
01:28:05,146 --> 01:28:06,921
Yes, sir. - Instruct
them to come with weapons..

1100
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:16,435
Ask them to come in Autos or Taxis.

1101
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:22,032
No official vehicles are to be used.

1102
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:23,938
Okay.
- Okay.

1103
01:28:24,032 --> 01:28:25,943
Sir.. there's a car outside..

1104
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:27,604
And it's not from this area.

1105
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:28,840
Car?
- Yes, sir.

1106
01:28:28,936 --> 01:28:31,143
A white Zen model at the corner..

1107
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:32,946
With a Thane registration number.

1108
01:28:36,277 --> 01:28:37,984
What's wrong.. everything alright?

1109
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:39,587
We have to go to Atul's home.

1110
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:41,919
Oh.

1111
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:44,793
Do you normally go this way..

1112
01:28:44,919 --> 01:28:47,092
Or are you just
trying to impress me?

1113
01:28:47,188 --> 01:28:48,462
You came here for the first time.

1114
01:28:48,723 --> 01:28:50,134
I thought I'd show
you the other way.

1115
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:51,528
Com e.

1116
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:57,507
Hello?
- Is he inside the house?

1117
01:28:58,032 --> 01:28:59,511
Yes.
- And the girl?

1118
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:01,906
She is with him.. in the bedroom.

1119
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:03,447
What about the security?

1120
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:05,242
There's one constable.

1121
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,444
Anyone else around..

1122
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:08,212
Police vehicle or officers?

1123
01:29:08,776 --> 01:29:10,983
No.
- Do you think we can kill him now?

1124
01:29:14,615 --> 01:29:17,095
Hi, Swati.
- Hi.

1125
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:19,323
Hi. Come.. come in.

1126
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:21,656
Are you leaving right now?
- Yes.

1127
01:29:22,457 --> 01:29:23,561
Okay.

1128
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:25,433
Swati ..
- Yes?

1129
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,062
Maya is..
- Okay.

1130
01:29:27,161 --> 01:29:28,572
You can kiss her
goodbye if you want to..

1131
01:29:28,663 --> 01:29:29,835
We'll close our eyes.

1132
01:29:29,931 --> 01:29:33,674
Oh no, we said goodbye
properly when we left his house.

1133
01:29:34,135 --> 01:29:36,206
Okay goodnight then.

1134
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:37,715
Come on.
- Bye.

1135
01:29:37,805 --> 01:29:38,909
Bye Maya.

1136
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,686
Atul?
- I'll be back.

1137
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:42,015
Good night.
- Good night. - Bye.

1138
01:29:42,276 --> 01:29:43,414
Good night.

1139
01:29:44,145 --> 01:29:45,647
Who was it?
- The call has been traced.

1140
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:47,956
Techies said the call
originated in China.

1141
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:49,221
IMEI number is a fake and..

1142
01:29:49,317 --> 01:29:50,557
The sim card is also from there.
- Right.

1143
01:29:50,685 --> 01:29:52,961
What did sir say?
- Sir said it's important that..

1144
01:29:53,087 --> 01:29:55,693
..Kamlesh and Mahesh are
there to identify the gangsters.

1145
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:58,094
You are the target, so it's
important for you to be there.

1146
01:29:58,192 --> 01:29:59,466
What about weapons?

1147
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:04,600
We'll see to it that
you won't need weapons.

1148
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:09,072
Such a brutal attack on Tahir..

1149
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:10,706
Confirms that it's
someone close to Reddy

1150
01:30:10,805 --> 01:30:12,807
In fact, he referred
to Reddy as Anna..

1151
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:14,215
And he sounded very angry.

1152
01:30:14,342 --> 01:30:15,912
He followed us the entire day.

1153
01:30:16,277 --> 01:30:19,656
In fact, he even knew that we
went for a film from Swati's office.

1154
01:30:19,981 --> 01:30:22,621
I am sure his men were
keeping a watch outside my house.

1155
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:25,396
Tonight he will
definitely attack me.

1156
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:28,098
That's when we will
know his identity.

1157
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:29,834
Yash, what if he doesn't show up?

1158
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:31,364
He will for sure.

1159
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:33,371
Let's give him a surprise.

1160
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:35,135
They are here.

1161
01:30:35,229 --> 01:30:36,674
Come on, Kamat.
- Yes sir.

1162
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:37,868
Sir.

1163
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:40,871
Sir.

1164
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:44,810
Sorry guys, I ruined your sleep.

1165
01:30:44,906 --> 01:30:46,647
No problem, sir.
- Okay.

1166
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:48,614
Either there's going to be
some awesome action tonight..

1167
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:50,447
Or nothing at all.

1168
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:52,983
If it doesn't happen, forgive me.

1169
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,488
Well if it does.. enjoy the action.

1170
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:57,888
By the way, the three
of us are handicapped.

1171
01:30:58,486 --> 01:31:00,488
We'll have to just
watch unless they run away

1172
01:31:01,889 --> 01:31:02,959
Let's go.

1173
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:04,599
Mahesh, Kamlesh..

1174
01:31:42,296 --> 01:31:43,798
That big black gate.

1175
01:32:11,425 --> 01:32:12,699
Get out.

1176
01:32:14,729 --> 01:32:16,208
Catch him.

1177
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:20,977
Don't try to run.

1178
01:32:27,275 --> 01:32:29,186
Don't try anything. Hands up!

1179
01:32:40,955 --> 01:32:42,263
You remember your name, don't you?

1180
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:44,134
Tonight you will have to tell me.

1181
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:46,136
Not so soon..

1182
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:49,007
I'll tell you when I want to.

1183
01:32:49,297 --> 01:32:52,437
Once you are inside the NCB lock
up, you will be eager to tell me.

1184
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:56,913
Let's see if you can even take
me to the lockup.. Yashvardhan.

1185
01:32:57,772 --> 01:33:00,548
I don't think you can take me
there, at least not in this lifetime.

1186
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:46,749
Vishnu! Remember my name.

1187
01:35:46,874 --> 01:35:48,444
I'm telling you on my own terms.

1188
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:50,453
Vishnu!

1189
01:36:02,857 --> 01:36:04,461
There's a definite
Hyderabad connection.

1190
01:36:05,126 --> 01:36:06,298
In our excitement of exposing..

1191
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:08,202
..The 10 billion rupee
drug empire of Reddy's..

1192
01:36:08,295 --> 01:36:09,865
We overlooked the Vishnu factor.

1193
01:36:10,498 --> 01:36:12,000
What about the abandoned vehicle?

1194
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:14,268
Stolen, sir.
Standard modus operandi.

1195
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:20,849
Identify the gangsters whose
bodies we've recovered. - Yes, sir.

1196
01:36:22,009 --> 01:36:24,182
Ask the Mumbai and
Hyderabad police for help.

1197
01:36:24,278 --> 01:36:25,382
Yes, sir.

1198
01:36:25,646 --> 01:36:26,750
Jadhav..

1199
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:28,957
Sir. - You will head to
Hyderabad in the morning.

1200
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:30,119
Yes, sir.

1201
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:32,631
But sir.. Excuse me, sir.

1202
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:34,526
Yash and I know this case well.

1203
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:36,226
I cannot revoke his suspension..

1204
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:38,360
Until I have orders
from the ministry.

1205
01:36:42,396 --> 01:36:45,206
Sir, this guy is
dangerous and impatient.

1206
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:47,669
He won't stay quiet.

1207
01:36:48,369 --> 01:36:50,440
He will attack us again, very soon.

1208
01:36:51,605 --> 01:36:52,743
Sir, please revoke our suspension..

1209
01:36:52,873 --> 01:36:55,945
We know this case.
- Don't be paranoid, Yash.

1210
01:36:57,745 --> 01:36:59,656
He knows we are ready.

1211
01:37:01,448 --> 01:37:04,190
He will think ten times
before attacking again.

1212
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:11,196
Thank you, sir.

1213
01:37:18,766 --> 01:37:20,211
Vasu called..

1214
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:22,278
He is scared.

1215
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:27,175
Vishnu, in this business,
be it life or money..

1216
01:37:27,541 --> 01:37:29,020
We bear every loss..

1217
01:37:30,077 --> 01:37:32,023
But we never strike
back at the police.

1218
01:37:32,413 --> 01:37:33,983
I know we don't.

1219
01:37:34,548 --> 01:37:35,993
That's why I'm making a start.

1220
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:40,830
Tell Vasu that after I
have dealt with those four..

1221
01:37:41,288 --> 01:37:44,292
The NCB won't dare trouble us again.

1222
01:37:50,231 --> 01:37:51,733
I'll sleep now, let's talk tomorrow.

1223
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:55,239
You make yourself comfortable, okay?

1224
01:37:55,336 --> 01:37:56,644
- Okay? - Good night.

1225
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,251
Sorry, Swati, I woke you up.

1226
01:38:01,575 --> 01:38:02,679
It's okay.

1227
01:38:03,978 --> 01:38:05,514
She is sleeping in
the room upstairs.

1228
01:38:06,947 --> 01:38:08,688
What happened? You want something?

1229
01:38:08,782 --> 01:38:10,591
No, nothing.
- Okay.

1230
01:38:11,252 --> 01:38:13,459
Where are you going?
- Sofa.

1231
01:38:13,988 --> 01:38:15,433
You don't need to sleep on the sofa.

1232
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:16,830
I don't like this at all.

1233
01:38:17,424 --> 01:38:19,028
Go upstairs to Maya's room.

1234
01:38:19,526 --> 01:38:22,837
It's a double bed but
you can sleep single, okay?

1235
01:38:31,839 --> 01:38:33,045
ACP sir..

1236
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:37,551
Where were you?

1237
01:38:38,379 --> 01:38:40,450
You kept me under
house arrest over here..

1238
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,254
And you took off.

1239
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,787
It would have been
better if I'd have gone home.

1240
01:38:49,056 --> 01:38:50,797
You can't go home right now, Maya.

1241
01:38:51,292 --> 01:38:52,771
Your life is in danger.

1242
01:38:53,427 --> 01:38:54,872
I am not scared of anyone.

1243
01:38:55,362 --> 01:38:58,309
But I am scared of living in
someone's guestroom for too long.

1244
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:00,709
Maya, I am serious.
- Me too, I swear.

1245
01:39:01,068 --> 01:39:02,172
You know what..

1246
01:39:02,303 --> 01:39:05,477
This is why l wanted to
avoid any kind of relationship.

1247
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:08,686
I knew if a
situation like this arose..

1248
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:10,221
You just wouldn't understand.

1249
01:39:12,546 --> 01:39:13,889
Is it a safety issue?

1250
01:39:17,518 --> 01:39:18,656
I'll take care.

1251
01:39:23,123 --> 01:39:25,569
There can't be any
safer place than this.

1252
01:39:26,527 --> 01:39:27,801
Problem solved.

1253
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:30,102
You are a total loss.

1254
01:39:30,998 --> 01:39:32,500
Completely insane.

1255
01:39:33,334 --> 01:39:34,404
San e.

1256
01:39:34,835 --> 01:39:36,178
I have seen you in action.

1257
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:38,281
Even if someone throws acid..

1258
01:39:38,372 --> 01:39:39,851
You coolly stand your ground.

1259
01:39:41,075 --> 01:39:43,351
Believe in yourself, sir.

1260
01:39:43,677 --> 01:39:45,247
You are quite good.

1261
01:39:45,846 --> 01:39:46,950
Maya.

1262
01:39:47,047 --> 01:39:48,526
Yashvardhan .

1263
01:39:57,391 --> 01:39:58,631
Don't stop..

1264
01:39:58,759 --> 01:40:00,033
I am not underage.

1265
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:01,798
Want to check my ID?

1266
01:40:27,921 --> 01:40:29,867
What is the typical line you use..

1267
01:40:29,957 --> 01:40:33,427
When someone doesn't
cooperate in the interrogation?

1268
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:37,004
Tell me.

1269
01:40:37,398 --> 01:40:39,639
Or we have ways of making you talk.

1270
01:40:47,441 --> 01:40:48,818
What will I do without you?

1271
01:40:50,544 --> 01:40:53,150
A month ago you said
"What will I do with you?"

1272
01:40:53,947 --> 01:40:55,358
You really are confused.

1273
01:41:02,356 --> 01:41:03,460
Hello?

1274
01:41:22,543 --> 01:41:23,681
Mahesh.

1275
01:41:23,777 --> 01:41:24,847
Mahesh!

1276
01:41:24,978 --> 01:41:26,184
No.

1277
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:38,862
Leave me. Mahesh!

1278
01:41:57,211 --> 01:42:00,784
Leave me. Mahesh!

1279
01:42:00,914 --> 01:42:02,791
Mahesh!

1280
01:42:28,542 --> 01:42:30,112
Mahesh!

1281
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:31,416
No.

1282
01:42:31,512 --> 01:42:34,322
Leave me. Please leave me.

1283
01:42:37,317 --> 01:42:38,660
Leave me.

1284
01:42:38,752 --> 01:42:40,595
Leave her. Please leave her.

1285
01:42:40,721 --> 01:42:42,928
And this is my
first gift for the NCB.

1286
01:42:43,056 --> 01:42:45,093
No.
- Leave her. Rachna.

1287
01:42:55,002 --> 01:42:56,675
How dare he?

1288
01:42:59,139 --> 01:43:02,882
Yash, I am revoking your suspension.

1289
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:08,457
I will call the ministry.
- Now you want to call the ministry?

1290
01:43:09,550 --> 01:43:10,654
Now?

1291
01:43:12,085 --> 01:43:13,758
Until now you didn't need us.

1292
01:43:15,122 --> 01:43:18,194
Your priority was to keep your
bosses in the ministry happy.

1293
01:43:19,793 --> 01:43:21,602
If it wasn't, Mahesh
would've been alive.

1294
01:43:24,097 --> 01:43:25,701
Sir, you left him defenseless..

1295
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:27,444
Without a gun on his person.

1296
01:43:28,302 --> 01:43:30,839
Sir, it wasn't an officer but a
suspended officer who was killed.

1297
01:43:33,173 --> 01:43:34,914
I told you we are not
dealing with a person.

1298
01:43:36,176 --> 01:43:37,519
I told you he's an animal.

1299
01:43:41,181 --> 01:43:43,252
He barged into the house
and killed him in cold blood.

1300
01:43:44,551 --> 01:43:46,656
He raped Rachana
just to prove a point.

1301
01:43:47,921 --> 01:43:49,161
And what did we do?

1302
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:51,230
We followed the law.

1303
01:43:51,992 --> 01:43:53,335
And what is the law?

1304
01:43:53,961 --> 01:43:55,372
To let innocents die.

1305
01:44:03,570 --> 01:44:05,243
Whether it's bomb blasts
or terrorist attacks..

1306
01:44:05,772 --> 01:44:07,615
Why do the directors and ministers..

1307
01:44:07,708 --> 01:44:09,085
..Have something to say
only after people are killed?

1308
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:12,315
Can't you say something
when people are still alive?

1309
01:44:14,348 --> 01:44:17,022
Sir, please tell the Joint Secretary
that Mahesh didn't do any wrong.

1310
01:44:18,885 --> 01:44:20,728
What's so bloody
wrong in killing Reddy?

1311
01:44:21,188 --> 01:44:22,929
He was also killing people.

1312
01:44:24,424 --> 01:44:25,903
I admit I was wrong.

1313
01:44:27,995 --> 01:44:29,838
Find and kill him.

1314
01:44:32,432 --> 01:44:34,343
I will deal with the
inquiry commission.

1315
01:45:55,982 --> 01:45:57,256
Where is Vishnu.

1316
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:58,694
Tell us.

1317
01:46:00,287 --> 01:46:03,097
Where is Vasu?
- I told you I don't know.

1318
01:46:16,069 --> 01:46:17,412
I told you I don't..

1319
01:46:26,947 --> 01:46:28,756
The Hyderabad police had said that..

1320
01:46:28,882 --> 01:46:30,623
Vishnu was killed in Mombasa.

1321
01:46:32,352 --> 01:46:34,798
The goons that were killed
or arrested at Yash's house..

1322
01:46:35,389 --> 01:46:37,801
Worked for a builder named Vasu.

1323
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,311
I've got a very strong feeling, sir.

1324
01:46:49,536 --> 01:46:50,947
If we get Vasu..

1325
01:46:51,905 --> 01:46:53,509
We will get Vishnu!

1326
01:46:53,607 --> 01:46:54,915
Where is Vasu?

1327
01:47:45,926 --> 01:47:47,599
Where is Vishnu?

1328
01:48:24,965 --> 01:48:29,107
Should I talk to Maya's
sister and postpone the wedding?

1329
01:48:29,469 --> 01:48:30,709
Why, Swati?

1330
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:32,715
Why should we postpone it?

1331
01:48:33,907 --> 01:48:36,786
You've shattered his network but
you haven't captured Vishnu yet.

1332
01:48:36,877 --> 01:48:38,447
Well it's only a matter of
time before he is captured.

1333
01:48:38,912 --> 01:48:41,722
We can't put our lives
on hold because of him.

1334
01:48:42,148 --> 01:48:44,128
But..
- He should get married.

1335
01:48:44,985 --> 01:48:48,023
Whether it's me or
Mahesh or any other cop..

1336
01:48:49,256 --> 01:48:53,068
We are well aware of the
pitfalls of this profession.

1337
01:48:53,293 --> 01:48:56,706
I was just saying that perhaps we
could wait until things calm down.

1338
01:48:57,397 --> 01:48:59,274
Swati, you know things
never calm down for us.

1339
01:48:59,599 --> 01:49:01,101
You know this very well.

1340
01:49:01,902 --> 01:49:04,075
Today it's Vishnu.. tomorrow
someone else will replace him.

1341
01:49:04,204 --> 01:49:06,241
I don't understand why we
can't take precautions..

1342
01:49:06,373 --> 01:49:08,751
I mean, what's wrong if we
postpone it by a few days?

1343
01:49:08,842 --> 01:49:10,446
We will send out a
message that we are scared to..

1344
01:49:10,544 --> 01:49:12,251
..Vishnu and the
other criminals like him.

1345
01:49:12,345 --> 01:49:13,756
But..
- Didn't you say that..

1346
01:49:14,548 --> 01:49:16,186
Not leading a normal life due..

1347
01:49:16,283 --> 01:49:17,990
To fear of a
criminal wasn't bravery..

1348
01:49:18,118 --> 01:49:19,256
But escapism?

1349
01:49:20,153 --> 01:49:22,463
Tomorrow I will bring
Maya here after the wedding.

1350
01:49:23,056 --> 01:49:25,798
Maya will live here, with me.

1351
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:28,232
Final?

1352
01:49:29,029 --> 01:49:30,303
Let's go together.

1353
01:49:30,397 --> 01:49:31,535
No.

1354
01:49:31,798 --> 01:49:33,505
I will bring Maya
along day after tomorrow.

1355
01:49:34,534 --> 01:49:36,673
We will celebrate
after Vishnu's death.

1356
01:50:11,004 --> 01:50:12,074
Hello?

1357
01:50:12,172 --> 01:50:13,549
Hello.

1358
01:50:13,673 --> 01:50:16,210
You answered the phone
that means no action yet.

1359
01:50:18,778 --> 01:50:20,314
Just stop here for a bit.

1360
01:50:23,249 --> 01:50:24,751
I will drop this at
the tailor's, okay?

1361
01:50:24,851 --> 01:50:26,922
Listen Swati, I will
park and come with you.

1362
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:28,192
It's in this lane, relax.

1363
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:30,029
Swati..
- Nothing.

1364
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:32,865
Your idiot friend is trying to
provide security everywhere I go.

1365
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:35,168
I missed all of you.

1366
01:50:35,495 --> 01:50:36,997
Come back soon.

1367
01:50:38,164 --> 01:50:39,802
Now hang up and..

1368
01:50:39,899 --> 01:50:41,776
...And just go and lose your virginity.
Please!

1369
01:50:43,303 --> 01:50:45,146
Bye.
- Bye.

1370
01:50:49,509 --> 01:50:50,351
Recognize me?

1371
01:50:51,077 --> 01:50:51,885
Vishnu.

1372
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:01,855
Are you happy?

1373
01:51:10,296 --> 01:51:11,240
Mahesh?

1374
01:51:17,737 --> 01:51:19,580
Yash, I told you..

1375
01:51:20,774 --> 01:51:24,017
It takes a while to forget things.

1376
01:51:26,646 --> 01:51:28,717
We could've married later.

1377
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:31,256
Don't worry about it.

1378
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:34,798
Are you happy?

1379
01:51:36,322 --> 01:51:37,562
This was your dream.

1380
01:51:38,992 --> 01:51:40,164
Well, I am happy.

1381
01:51:43,129 --> 01:51:45,473
There's a lot I want to say to you.

1382
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:48,945
But today..

1383
01:51:50,370 --> 01:51:52,646
For some reason I am lost for words.

1384
01:51:53,673 --> 01:51:56,483
You will look odd if you don't talk.

1385
01:51:59,813 --> 01:52:02,919
"How do I tell you
even if I wish to?"

1386
01:52:03,249 --> 01:52:06,560
"What the heart wishes to say."

1387
01:52:06,986 --> 01:52:09,967
"How do I pick my dreams?"

1388
01:52:10,523 --> 01:52:14,061
"The ocean keeps flowing."

1389
01:52:21,468 --> 01:52:24,506
"How do I tell you
even if I wish to?"

1390
01:52:24,938 --> 01:52:28,408
"What the heart wishes to say."

1391
01:52:28,675 --> 01:52:32,054
"How do I pick my dreams?"

1392
01:52:32,178 --> 01:52:35,489
"The ocean keeps flowing."

1393
01:52:35,982 --> 01:52:39,259
"listen to what..

1394
01:52:39,486 --> 01:52:42,660
.. My silence says."

1395
01:52:43,089 --> 01:52:46,536
"The saga is longer..

1396
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:50,173
..Than this night."

1397
01:52:51,498 --> 01:52:55,139
"How do I say it? How do I say it?"

1398
01:53:13,386 --> 01:53:16,890
"I wanted to say to you."

1399
01:53:17,023 --> 01:53:20,402
"I wanted to say to you, my love."

1400
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:24,107
"What do I say..

1401
01:53:24,197 --> 01:53:27,735
..When you are right before me."

1402
01:53:28,334 --> 01:53:34,944
"What are these feelings?"

1403
01:53:35,108 --> 01:53:40,990
"The heart's filled with it."

1404
01:53:42,348 --> 01:53:48,196
"It's feels shy to be expressed."

1405
01:53:49,556 --> 01:53:56,030
"But it always
reflects in the eyes."

1406
01:53:57,297 --> 01:54:00,301
"How do I tell you
even if I wish to?"

1407
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:04,170
"What the heart wishes to say."

1408
01:54:32,632 --> 01:54:34,543
"Why do we say.

1409
01:54:34,634 --> 01:54:39,913
..What's unsaid?"

1410
01:54:40,006 --> 01:54:43,544
"it's the night..

1411
01:54:43,676 --> 01:54:46,987
..For the hearts to convey."

1412
01:54:47,313 --> 01:54:53,696
"The heart speaks."

1413
01:54:54,454 --> 01:55:00,996
"They unfold the secrets."

1414
01:55:01,594 --> 01:55:08,569
"There are dream s,
feelings and expressions."

1415
01:55:08,935 --> 01:55:16,080
"What's there to say
when we are so close?"

1416
01:55:16,509 --> 01:55:19,820
"How do I tell you
even if I wish to?"

1417
01:55:20,046 --> 01:55:23,516
"What the heart wishes to say."

1418
01:55:23,783 --> 01:55:27,196
"How do I pick my dreams?"

1419
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:30,631
"The ocean keeps flowing."

1420
01:55:31,090 --> 01:55:37,871
"Listen to what my silence says."

1421
01:55:38,197 --> 01:55:45,843
"The saga is
longer than this night."

1422
01:55:46,739 --> 01:55:50,551
"How do I say it?"

1423
01:56:38,324 --> 01:56:39,132
Yash !

1424
01:56:53,406 --> 01:56:54,578
Yash !

1425
01:57:02,782 --> 01:57:04,693
Vishnu, this enmity
is between you and me.

1426
01:57:05,051 --> 01:57:05,893
Let Maya go.

1427
01:57:06,185 --> 01:57:07,255
Come on Yash!

1428
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:12,460
You could at least come up
with a better line to save her.

1429
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:14,665
By the way..

1430
01:57:14,994 --> 01:57:16,701
It was never really
between the two of us.

1431
01:57:17,096 --> 01:57:18,734
Dealing in drugs was
our business and..

1432
01:57:18,831 --> 01:57:20,310
Fighting against it
was your business.

1433
01:57:20,633 --> 01:57:22,340
We were both doing
our respective jobs.

1434
01:57:22,902 --> 01:57:25,041
You should've done your
part by arresting Anna.

1435
01:57:25,371 --> 01:57:26,907
I would have posted
Anna's bail and done my part.

1436
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:28,075
None of this would've happened.

1437
01:57:29,909 --> 01:57:31,149
But then you decided to play God.

1438
01:57:32,879 --> 01:57:34,483
And Anna was..

1439
01:57:37,583 --> 01:57:39,426
You have given me a lot of pain.

1440
01:57:40,119 --> 01:57:43,259
Now it's time.. for payback.

1441
01:57:55,101 --> 01:57:56,273
Yash !

1442
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:11,390
No.

1443
01:58:11,884 --> 01:58:14,160
The deal was I will tell
you where Yash is and..

1444
01:58:14,287 --> 01:58:15,664
You would let Swati go.

1445
01:58:15,755 --> 01:58:16,927
That was the deal.
- Wrong!

1446
01:58:18,057 --> 01:58:21,903
The deal was I'd let Swati
free when Yash is killed.

1447
01:58:22,128 --> 01:58:22,697
If you..

1448
01:58:23,796 --> 01:58:27,073
If you couldn't kill
Yash it's not my fault.

1449
01:58:27,366 --> 01:58:29,505
Your fault is you took
him to the hospital..

1450
01:58:29,635 --> 01:58:31,637
..And got his bullets removed.

1451
01:58:32,905 --> 01:58:34,748
But you can do something
to correct your fault.

1452
01:58:35,041 --> 01:58:36,543
I'll give you another chance.

1453
01:58:37,743 --> 01:58:39,848
Neither I nor my men can come there.

1454
01:58:40,346 --> 01:58:41,347
Since you are there..

1455
01:58:42,515 --> 01:58:45,189
Kill him. I will let Swati go.

1456
02:00:04,697 --> 02:00:07,109
Joint Director of
NCB ACP Yashvardhan..

1457
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:11,171
Succumbed to his bullet wounds
in a local hospital in Panchgani.

1458
02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:14,683
It's said that ACP Yashwardhan had
gone to Panchgani for his marriage.

1459
02:00:14,774 --> 02:00:17,755
But even his
would-be wife is missing.

1460
02:00:17,877 --> 02:00:19,720
He was brought here
after he was shot.

1461
02:00:19,946 --> 02:00:22,426
The doctors say that
he was recovering well..

1462
02:00:22,548 --> 02:00:23,583
But six months back..

1463
02:00:23,716 --> 02:00:28,256
"ACP Yashwardhan was responsible for
wiping out four major drug cartels.

1464
02:00:28,354 --> 02:00:30,527
Report suggest the
involvement of one of these gangs

1465
02:00:30,623 --> 02:00:32,694
in the attack on ACP
Yashwardhan's life.

1466
02:00:32,792 --> 02:00:33,770
However the Home Ministry.

1467
02:00:33,859 --> 02:00:36,271
Our sources say he was recovering..

1468
02:00:36,395 --> 02:00:39,239
But today he suddenly
stopped breathing and died.

1469
02:00:44,537 --> 02:00:45,481
I killed him.

1470
02:00:45,771 --> 02:00:47,250
I will text you the address.

1471
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:49,248
You better come alone.

1472
02:00:49,609 --> 02:00:50,849
Come and take your wife.

1473
02:01:42,561 --> 02:01:43,266
What did he say?

1474
02:01:43,596 --> 02:01:44,472
Where is Swati?

1475
02:01:45,464 --> 02:01:46,568
It's an Alibaug address.

1476
02:01:46,899 --> 02:01:48,776
- How many zones in Alibaug,
Kamlesh? - Six.

1477
02:01:49,001 --> 02:01:50,674
And who is the ACP there?
- Gaitonde.

1478
02:01:51,003 --> 02:01:52,778
Can we get the local task force?
- Easily.

1479
02:01:52,872 --> 02:01:54,442
Sawant, how many
vehicles do we have?

1480
02:01:54,573 --> 02:01:55,415
Yash..

1481
02:01:57,710 --> 02:01:58,518
I am sorry

1482
02:02:03,082 --> 02:02:04,322
What I did to you..

1483
02:02:04,450 --> 02:02:07,556
Any one of us would have
done the same for Swati.

1484
02:02:10,690 --> 02:02:11,964
Swati will be fine.

1485
02:02:13,693 --> 02:02:14,603
And Maya?

1486
02:02:36,048 --> 02:02:37,049
We will find her, Atul.

1487
02:02:38,984 --> 02:02:41,362
We know where Swati is..
let's get her first.

1488
02:02:41,754 --> 02:02:43,199
Yash, you're in no condition to..
- I'm fine..

1489
02:02:43,322 --> 02:02:44,323
just get the task force going.
- Yash..

1490
02:02:44,590 --> 02:02:46,092
Insert the IV back, officer.
- You can't go alone please.

1491
02:02:47,193 --> 02:02:48,365
I don't want it, nurse.

1492
02:02:48,728 --> 02:02:50,571
Just give me a high dose painkiller.

1493
02:02:51,330 --> 02:02:52,172
It better be a painkiller..

1494
02:02:52,865 --> 02:02:54,139
And not a sedative.

1495
02:02:54,867 --> 02:02:57,177
Otherwise l will kill you
as soon as I'm conscious.

1496
02:04:22,121 --> 02:04:22,963
Yash.

1497
02:04:23,389 --> 02:04:24,231
Yash.

1498
02:04:27,026 --> 02:04:29,199
Don't go inside.

1499
02:04:30,095 --> 02:04:32,041
Why?
- Nothing, come on, let's go.

1500
02:04:33,766 --> 02:04:34,904
Move..

1501
02:04:41,173 --> 02:04:42,948
Swati ! Swati !

1502
02:04:44,376 --> 02:04:46,117
Swati !
- Yash!

1503
02:04:46,378 --> 02:04:48,051
Yash.. help me!

1504
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:51,386
Swati. Yash.. help me!

1505
02:04:51,784 --> 02:04:52,956
Yash.. help me!

1506
02:05:01,827 --> 02:05:03,135
Yash.. help me!

1507
02:05:07,900 --> 02:05:09,243
This is all my fault.

1508
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:29,196
Yash..

1509
02:05:52,244 --> 02:05:53,052
Hello.

1510
02:05:53,579 --> 02:05:54,557
Atul..

1511
02:05:56,048 --> 02:05:57,686
Is Atul there?
- I knew he wouldn't be there.

1512
02:06:02,254 --> 02:06:03,892
The officers who have a conscience..

1513
02:06:03,989 --> 02:06:05,491
Don't need to be killed.

1514
02:06:06,458 --> 02:06:08,768
They take their own life as soon
as they realize their mistake.

1515
02:06:09,061 --> 02:06:11,803
You too won't get out alive, bastard

1516
02:06:12,865 --> 02:06:15,141
Maya.. I don't want her.

1517
02:06:15,734 --> 02:06:18,681
I wanted those three and you.

1518
02:06:19,672 --> 02:06:20,446
Are you coming?

1519
02:06:20,673 --> 02:06:23,347
Or do you have no interest in
a dead officer's girlfriend?

1520
02:06:23,809 --> 02:06:27,313
You killed one of us.. you..

1521
02:06:33,886 --> 02:06:35,058
What do you want?

1522
02:06:35,321 --> 02:06:36,857
I want to kill you.

1523
02:06:37,656 --> 02:06:38,760
You better come alone.

1524
02:06:39,224 --> 02:06:40,669
Don't make the
mistake that Atul did.

1525
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:42,466
If I see the team ..

1526
02:06:43,262 --> 02:06:45,139
You will surely survive but..

1527
02:06:45,264 --> 02:06:47,369
You will be
responsible for Maya's death.

1528
02:06:48,834 --> 02:06:49,835
I will come alone.

1529
02:07:44,957 --> 02:07:45,958
There's only one left..

1530
02:08:10,349 --> 02:08:11,692
Kamlesh!
- I am fine.

1531
02:08:12,551 --> 02:08:13,859
Yash, I am fine. You go!

1532
02:08:14,486 --> 02:08:15,362
Go.. don't let him get away!

1533
02:08:15,688 --> 02:08:16,758
Kill him!

1534
02:08:38,911 --> 02:08:40,481
You don't need to come up.

1535
02:08:42,614 --> 02:08:44,252
I'm sending Maya down.

1536
02:08:52,891 --> 02:08:53,801
Maya!

1537
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:15,790
Maya!

1538
02:09:16,181 --> 02:09:17,683
Maya!

1539
02:09:26,625 --> 02:09:27,194
Maya!

1540
02:09:29,194 --> 02:09:33,267
And then one day I want
to close my eyes and..

1541
02:09:34,333 --> 02:09:37,803
Peacefully die in your arms.

1542
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:45,219
Only one dream was fulfilled,
ACP sir.

1543
02:09:45,477 --> 02:09:46,080
Maya.

1544
02:09:50,182 --> 02:09:51,786
The other dreams..

1545
02:09:53,886 --> 02:09:54,796
Maya!

1546
02:09:56,221 --> 02:09:57,131
Maya!

1547
02:09:58,624 --> 02:09:59,534
Maya!

1548
02:10:17,176 --> 02:10:17,881
Maya!

1549
02:10:35,194 --> 02:10:36,332
I told you..

1550
02:10:36,762 --> 02:10:38,503
Your agony would
continue even after your death.

1551
02:15:26,351 --> 02:15:27,056
Yash..

1552
02:15:27,552 --> 02:15:29,657
Yes, Kamlesh.
- We have a new informer.

1553
02:15:30,489 --> 02:15:31,490
I'll be there.

1554
02:15:37,395 --> 02:15:38,999
l'll be back home late tonight.
